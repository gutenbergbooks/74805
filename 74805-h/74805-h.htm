<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
TREATS OF ARITHMETIC.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "A little way, a very little way<br>
  (Life is so short), they dig into the rind,<br>
  And they are very sorry, so they say,&mdash;<br>
  Sorry for what they find."&mdash;<i>Jean Ingelow.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I have always thought the history of the ugly
duckling one of the truest and most pathetic of
all stories.  It commences in the sad minor key, a
long prelude of oppression, of misunderstanding.
The unknown creature, sombre of plumage, makes
no way among its companions; its folded-up
beauties remain hidden.  The duck-pond represents
the world.  Amidst plenty of quackery and
folly the weaker goes to the wall.  By and by
the key changes; the long neck arches above
the weeds; amid a burst of triumph the ugly
duckling sails away into fairy-land a beautiful
swan.
</p>

<p>
After all there is a wonderful moral hidden
under these quaint old stories.  Beauty and goodness
always go together; the ugly sister, dropping
toads instead of diamonds and roses, is only the
poetical incarnation of envy and discontent; truth
and mercy and kindness to the aged always
unfold themselves under the garb of a beautiful
young girl.  And so the children glean precious
stones of wisdom, odd-shaped and many-colored,
out of the fanciful borders of fairy-land.
</p>

<p>
Queenie Marriott once compared herself and her
little sister Emmie to the ugly duckling of the
fable.  "There must be two of them," she said;
"only it was dubious whether either of them
would become swans."
</p>

<p>
No one at Granite Lodge understood them;
certainly not Miss Titheridge, or the other
teachers, or the girls, unless it were Cathy, and
even Cathy, much as she loved them, voted them
peculiar.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was only speaking metaphorically when
she made this droll simile&mdash;the grave young
teacher, Madam Dignity, as the other girls had
nicknamed her, was sufficiently alive to her own
attractions not to fear unjust comparisons.
</p>

<p>
Without being handsome, Queenie was woman
enough to know that her clear brown complexion,
white teeth, and brown velvety eyes would win a
certain amount of commendation.  Queenie's eyes,
as she well knew, were her strong point&mdash;they
were of singular depth and expression.  Some one
once remarked that they reminded him of brown
wells, for they had no bottom.  Somebody was
right; but they were not mild eyes for all that.
</p>

<p>
But we must tell how Queenie Marriott became
a teacher at Miss Titheridge's, in the select
establishment for young ladies at Granite Lodge, where
her little sister Emmie was a sort of foundation
scholar, or demi-semi-boarder, as one witty young
lady described her, with reference to the somewhat
scanty scholastic privileges eked out by Miss
Titheridge in return for unmitigated drudgery on
Queenie's part, and a trifling stipend paid out
of Queenie's poor little purse; the contents of
which barely sufficed to find them in decent
clothing.
</p>

<p>
Her own and part of Emmie's board were all
the wages Queenie received for her endurance
and patient labor; and half of the miserable
little pittance of forty pounds a year, left to
her by her mother, was paid quarterly into Miss
Titheridge's hand, invariably received by Miss
Titheridge in the same stony manner, and
acknowledged in the same words:&mdash;"I hope you
and Emily will always be grateful to us, Miss
Marriott, for the handsome and gratuitous
manner in which my poor sister and myself
have befriended you" (the second Miss Titheridge
had been dead fifteen years, but it was Miss
Titheridge's way always to associate the deceased
as though she were still the partner of her
labors).  "There would have been very few in
this mercenary world who would have acted
as generously, but, as Caroline always beautifully
puts it, we do it 'not to be seen of men.'"  After
which speech it was odd that the visitors to
Granite Lodge, when they were ushered into the
school-room, always gazed curiously at the young
teacher, and then at a certain closely-cropped head
in the darkest corner, and went out whispering
to themselves of Miss Titheridge's Christianity
and magnanimity of soul.  In more than one
case the story turned the scale in the mind of a
dubious parent, who after such a recital could
not but trust their darlings under the care of so
good a creature as Miss Titheridge.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, she actually supports those two
poor orphans; she assured me that a few pounds
are all she receives, and that is pressed upon her.
Can you conceive such generosity?" went on one
warm-hearted visitor, the mother of seven female
hopes, at least to Miss Titheridge; "a poor
hard-working school-mistress, and treats them as
though they were her own daughters."
</p>

<p>
Queenie and Em and their staunch friend
Cathy could have told a different tale, less
varnished and highly colored.  Miss Titheridge's
adopted daughters fared somewhat scantily;
not indeed on the bread and water of affliction,
but on bread on which the butter was
spread sparingly, on cold tea, on the least tempting
cuts of the joint after the young ladies were
served.  And they were lodged somewhat coldly,
in a large roomy attic, with a draughty window
and no fireplace, wherein little Em's hands
became at times very blue and chilled&mdash;a place
much haunted by a sportive family of mice, who
gambolled and nibbled through the small hours
of the night, with an occasional squeak from
Mr. or Mrs. Mouse that roused Queenie, dozing
uneasily under the thin blankets, and kept her
awake and shivering for hours.  These were
hardships certainly, but, as Queenie was given
to observe somewhat bitterly, she was used to
hardships.
</p>

<p>
Queenie and her little half-sister Emily were
the daughters of a clergyman, who held a living
in the north of England, at first in Lancashire,
which afterwards he had exchanged for one in
Yorkshire.
</p>

<p>
Queenie never recollected her mother, but she
did not long miss maternal care, which was
warmly lavished upon her by her young step-mother.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was only seven years old when her
father married again; he had made an excellent
choice in his second wife, and, as was extremely
rare in such cases, had secured a real mother for
his little girl.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Marriott was not a judicious woman in
some respects, but she was extremely
warm-hearted and sensitive; she would have thought
it the height of injustice to make any difference
between the children, even though one was her
own, and she prided herself on treating them
with equal tenderness.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Marriott was devotedly attached to his
wife and children, and yet it could not be said
that he was a happy man.  He had one fault&mdash;he
was a bad arithmetician; throughout his life
he never could be made to understand that a
pound did not consist of thirty shillings.
</p>

<p>
It sounds ludicrous, impossible.  A highly
educated man, and a good Christian, nevertheless
it was the case.  This mistaken notion spoiled
his life, and brought him to his death a
broken-spirited man.
</p>

<p>
Queenie never recollected the time when her
father was not in debt; the sweet domestic life of
the Vicarage was poisoned and blighted by this
upas-tree shadow of poverty.  Mrs. Marriott's
pretty-girl bloom died out under it, her soft
cheek grew thin and haggard.  It haunted the
study chair where Mr. Marriott spent hours of
hard brain and heart labor for his people; it
spoke despondently in his sermons; it weakened
the strong head and arm, and marred their usefulness.
</p>

<p>
This man was faulty, depend on it; he had
begun life at the wrong end; he had been bred
up in luxury, and had educated himself to the
pitch of fastidiousness; he would preach the
gospel, and yet not endure hardness, neither
would he lay aside the purple and fine linen
that should be his by inheritance.
</p>

<p>
Fresh from the university, he had commenced
life in this wise.  Long before prudence would
have dreamed of such a thing, he had taken a
wife to himself, a beautiful young creature, also a
clergyman's daughter, who brought her husband
a dowry of forty pounds a year.
</p>

<p>
After her death, which occurred when Queenie
was two years old, there was a long sad interval
of confusion and mismanagement.  An extravagant
master and extravagant servants made sad
havoc in an income that ought to have sufficed
for comfort and competence.
</p>

<p>
The young widower was in sore plight when
Emily Calcott married him, thereby angering
and alienating her only remaining relative, a
brother, at that time a wealthy solicitor in
Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid that you should do this thing,
Emily!" he had said to her, not unkindly, but
with the hardness habitual to him.  "If you marry
Frank Marriott you will live to rue the day you
ever became his wife; thriftless, extravagant,
and already in debt they tell me, and burthened
with a child.  Pause a moment before you decide,
and remember that you must choose between him
and me."
</p>

<p>
Emily Calcott paused many moments before
she consented to shake off the dust of her brother's
house, and shut out from him the light of her
fair face, the only one his crabbed and narrowed
nature ever really loved.  But Frank Marriott
was a goodly enough man to look upon, and had
dangerous gifts of persuasiveness; and pity in her
soft heart was even stronger than love, and he
seemed so helpless, left with his little child; and
so she married him.  She had walked, poor
thing, open-eyed into a very pitfall of shifting
perplexity.  From the very first she found
herself entangled in a web of every-day worry and
annoyance; small debts grew larger and widened
pitiably; and so the woman's honest soul grew
faint and weak, and no purpose, however strong,
and no effort, however well sustained, seemed to
extricate them.
</p>

<p>
It was just that mistake of thirty shillings in
the pound that caused the fatal mischief.  Queenie,
young as she was, soon grasped the truth of it all.
</p>

<p>
"We are poor because we have never learned
to do without things," she said once to her father,
whom she loved tenderly, and yet, saddest of all
things in a girl's life, whom she somehow failed to
honour.  She had gone to him like a zealous young
reformer, to organize a new regime in that troubled
household.  Her stepmother was dead&mdash;prematurely
faded and worn out&mdash;and things seemed
tending to some painful crisis.  "It isn't honest
to do what we are doing; we must measure our
needs by our purse.  I am not ashamed of our
poverty, or of my shabby dresses," went on the
girl, in a hard, proud voice, with a little gasp
in it.  "Mamma did not mind it, neither do
I.  But what shames me is to know that we
have not paid people, that we never shall if we
go on like this.  Papa, papa, do rouse yourself,
and look into things, and you will see what I
mean."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, child, so I will," he had answered,
cowed by her earnestness and by some presentiment
of the truth; but the effort killed him.
</p>

<p>
He had not been a wilfully dishonest man, he
had merely "not learned to do without things,"
as Queenie put it in her childish way.  He was
a gentleman, and such things had become the
necessaries of life to him.  The pound had not
yielded him thirty shillings after all.
</p>

<p>
People said the Vicarage was unhealthy, not
properly drained and ventilated, or a low fever
would not have carried off both husband and
wife.  But might it not have been that, in the
old Biblical phrase, the man's spirit had died
within him, and left him an easy prey to the
fever?
</p>

<p>
Queenie thought so as she sat beside him in
those long night watches.  "What a fool I have
been about money and everything!" she heard
him mutter once.  Oh, if he had only learned to
do without things, how much happier for them
all!
</p>

<p>
It was an unhealthy home atmosphere for a
girl to breathe.  Queenie grew up with two very
prominent ideas: first, that money was essential
to happiness, and secondly, that honesty and
self-denial were two of the greatest virtues.  Poverty
is a hard task-master to the young.  Queenie
became a little hard and reticent in her
self-reliance; she made bitter speeches occasionally,
and had odd little spasms of repressed passion.
But she had two weak points, Emmie and Cathy,
and she would have worked her fingers to the
bone for either.
</p>

<p>
Between her and Miss Titheridge there was
war to the death.  A few of the girls disliked her,
two or three feared her, to the rest she was purely
indifferent.  She was their equal, but because of
her shabbiness and poverty they choose to regard
her as their inferior.  Quiet disdain, unmitigated
reserve should be her rôle for the future.
</p>

<p>
Neither did she owe Miss Titheridge any
gratitude.  Miss Titheridge had a conscientious
teacher cheap, that was all.  She had paid her
own and Emmie's board over and over again by
hours of ceaseless drudgery and painstaking
work.
</p>

<p>
"She gives me stones instead of bread," she
said once to her only confidante.  "What do I
owe her, Cathy?  Has she ever a kind word or
look for us? is she ever otherwise than hard on
Emmie?  It makes me miserable to see Emmie;
she is pining like a bird in a cage.  Sometimes I
think I would rather live with Emmie in a garret,
and take in plain needle-work.  We could talk to
each other then, and I could tell her stories, and
make her laugh; she never laughs now, Cathy."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Queenie; you are so impetuous.  I
have a plan in my head, a dear, delightful plan.
We shall see, we shall see."

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
GRANITE LODGE.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "O shun, my friend, avoid that dangerous coast,<br>
  Where peace expires and fair affection's lost;<br>
  By wit, by grief, by anger urged, forbear<br>
  The speech contemptuous and the scornful air."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dr. John Langharne.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
How Queenie became the under teacher at
Miss Titheridge's must be told here shortly.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was only seventeen when her father
died, but she had already formed her own plans
of independence.  The repressive atmosphere of a
companion's or governess's existence was
peculiarly repugnant to her taste.  Teaching was
indeed her forte.  She had plenty of patience
and industry; her love of children was deep and
inherent; but she felt that she must seek another
channel, where she could work off superfluous
energy and attain independence.  She would be
a national school-mistress.  Aided by a friend, of
whom we must speak anon, Queenie so far carried
out her determination that she spent the next
two years at a training college at Durham, and
had just obtained a second class certificate when
new difficulties intervened.
</p>

<p>
The old nurse with whom she had placed
Emmie died; the little stock of money which had
been collected for the orphans by sympathizing
friends was diminishing daily.  Where could she
find a home for Emmie?  It was at this juncture
that Miss Titheridge, who knew the Marriotts of
old, and who was just now in sore need of an
under governess, stepped in with a magnanimous
offer.  Miss Marriott should give her services in
return for Emmie's board and education.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had hours of secret fretting before
she could make up her mind to relinquish her
cherished independence.  Miss Titheridge was
personally odious to her.  The decorous rules
and monotony of the life would oppress and
weigh upon her.  Still beggars must not be
choosers, as her old friend Caleb Runciman often
said; and it was for Emmie's sake.  Oh, if Miss
Titheridge would only be kind to Emmie, how
she would work for her, how she would show her
gratitude!
</p>

<p>
Futile hope!  Before many months were over,
Queenie bitterly rued the false step she had
taken, and grew sullen with a sense of repressed
wrong.  Little Emmie drooped and pined in the
unloving and uncongenial atmosphere.  The poor
little sensitive plant grew mentally dwarfed; the
young shoots ceased to expand.  Queenie could
have wrung her hands with anguish when she
thought of her own weakness and impotence to
avert the mischief.  Emmie's bright intelligence
grew blunted; a constant system of fault-finding
and rigorous punishment cowed and stupefied
the child's timid spirit; only kindness and
judicious training could avail with such a
nature.
</p>

<p>
Emmie did not grow sullen, her temper was
too sweet and mild to harbor resentful feelings;
but she became morbid and over sensitive.
Deprived of the recreation natural to children, her
imagination became unhealthily developed; she
peopled the old garret with fancies, and not
infrequently raised a Frankenstein of her own
creation.
</p>

<p>
Queenie sometimes found her cowering in the
window recess in the twilight in a perfect stupor
of terror, for which she could give no tangible
reason.  It was dark, and she was afraid, and
she did not like to come down into the schoolroom,
as she was in disgrace with Fraulein, and
so on.  Poor pitiful fragments out of a child's life,
small every-day tyrannies, little seeds of
unkindness dropped into virgin soil, to bring forth
perhaps a terrible harvest.
</p>

<p>
Queenie's passionate love could not shield the
little sister; the two could only cling to each
other in mute sorrow, each trying to hide from
the other how much they suffered.
</p>

<p>
"I am only tolerably miserable," Emmie would
say sometimes, in her droll, unchildish way.
"Don't cry, Queenie; you and I and dear old
Caleb will live together some day I know, when
I am a woman perhaps, and then we shall forget
all our troubles," and Emmie would hide the
little blackened hand on which Fraulein's ruler
had come down so sharply that day, and say
nothing of the pain, for fear Queenie should
fret.  But with all her childish troubles, Emmie
suffered less than the elder sister.  Queenie
would lie awake with aching head and throbbing
pulses night after night, revolving schemes for
delivering them both from the house of bondage,
as she phrased it.
</p>

<p>
And every night Emmie prayed her poor little
prayer that she might not hate Miss Titheridge,
and that she and Queenie and Caleb might live
together in a little house all by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Emmie was never weary of describing this
ideal house.  It must have four rooms and a
cupboard, and a little garden in front, where they
might grow sweet peas and roses.
</p>

<p>
"I should hate to be rich; should not you,
Queenie?" she would say sometimes.  "Caleb
would not be able to smoke his long pipes then."
</p>

<p>
Caleb Runciman was the only friend they
knew outside the gates of Granite Lodge, for
Queenie had long ago broken with the old
acquaintances whom she had known when her
father was alive.  Some had been offended at
her independence and unwillingness to take their
advice, others had merely cooled, a few had
forgotten the orphans.  Queenie was too proud to
remind them of her existence; but she and
Emmie clung to their old friend Caleb Runciman.
He was the old confidential clerk of their uncle,
Andrew Calcott, who was still the principal
solicitor in Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
Andrew Calcott had never forgiven his sister
her marriage with Frank Marriott.  She had
chosen between them, he said, and must abide
by her decision.  The hard, jealous nature had
received a secret blow from which it never
recovered.  In a moment of bitter passion he had
uttered a terrible oath, which only poor Emily
Calcott and Caleb Runciman heard, that neither
she nor any child of hers should ever have a
penny of his money.
</p>

<p>
"It is your money, Andrew, not mine," Emily
had answered very sadly and meekly, for after
her unfortunate marriage much of her old spirit
had died out; "but you should not be so hard on
me, my dear," and as she spoke Andrew Calcott's
cheek had turned very pale.
</p>

<p>
"Depend upon it, my dear young lady, he
repented of his speech the moment it had passed
his lips," Caleb had said more than once to
Queenie as he narrated this circumstance, which
he was fond of doing with a great deal of
dramatic energy.  "Aye, that was a terrible oath
be took, and enough to blacken any man's soul;
no wonder he grows harder every year; and his
temper is enough to try a saint, let alone a poor
sinner like me, till we daren't answer him for
fear of flying in a passion."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Calcott lived in a large handsome house
in Botchergate.  Queenie and Emmie had often
met him when they walked out in double file to
take the air, as Miss Titheridge termed the daily
exercise, and Emmie had always shrunk nearer to
her sister at the sight of the tall, austere-looking
man, who sometimes eyed them so sternly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Calcott knew the little girl in the shabby
garment, who always walked last in the procession,
holding so tightly to her companion's hand,
was his dead sister's only child; he knew as
well that the older girl was Frank Marriott's
daughter, but he never acknowledged the
relationship save by a deeper frown.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Caleb Runciman could only befriend
them in secret.  On their rare holidays the sisters
would slip through the streets in the twilight, and
steal into the small, two-storied house, with its
dark entry and small wainscoted parlour looking
out on the winding street.
</p>

<p>
How they loved that parlour, Emmie especially,
with its slippery horsehair sofa and wooden
rocking-chair.  The very blue china tiles that
lined the fireplace, and the red and drab
tablecloth on the little round table, were objects of
beauty in her opinion.  Caleb, with his watery
blue eyes, and cheeks like withered apples, and
stubbly grey hair, was the handsomest man she
had ever seen.  She liked his brown, snuffy
waistcoat and silver chain; his satin stock with its
coral pin was simply gorgeous.  Had not dear
mamma when a little girl sat on his knee, and
hugged him as Emmie did, when he slipped the
new shilling into her hand on Christmas Eve?
To pour tea out of the little black teapot and
partake of hot buttered cakes that his old servant
Molly had made was Emmie's greatest treat; her
thin cheeks would grow quite pink with
excitement, her large blue eyes, generally so dim,
would widen and brighten.
</p>

<p>
"She looks almost pretty then, Cathy," Queenie
would say triumphantly to her friend; "if only
Miss Titheridge had not cut off her curls."
</p>

<p>
Cathy used to listen to this sisterly praise in
silence.  In her eyes Emmie was certainly a very
plain child.  She had an old, sickly-looking face,
which the closely-cropped light hair did not set
off to advantage; besides which, she was angular
and ungainly, and her frocks were always too
short for her.
</p>

<p>
Other coins besides the bright shilling found
their way into the sisters' slender purses; a shy,
hesitating hand would push the shining gold
piece into Queenie's palm.  "It is for Emmie.
Bless you, my dear, that poor lamb is deprived
of thousands, absolutely thousands.  There, take it;
I have plenty, and to spare; it will get her some
toy or other."  And Queenie, swallowing down
the odd lump in her throat, would thank the old
man, and go home rejoicing, thinking of the new
hat or the warm winter stockings it would buy
for Emmie.
</p>

<p>
Granite Lodge was a large grey house of
imposing aspect, but hardly giving one the idea of
a cheerful residence, the blank, desolate look
being strongly suggestive of a jail or a
work-house.  One of the girls, the wag of the school,
had once chalked up over the door those famous
words of Dante, "All ye who enter here leave
hope behind," a jest dearly rued by the whole
school, and expiated by many a bitter task, the
innocent suffering with the guilty.  Heavy iron
gates clanged to and fro with metallic sound,
infusing vague sentiments of alarm in the breasts
of timid pupils.  The windows were high and
narrow; everywhere there were grey neutral
tints; the young footsteps echoed drearily on the
stone hall and staircase.
</p>

<p>
It was the weekly half-holiday; the large
classrooms were empty and deserted, save for one
occupant.  Miss Titheridge's young ladies,
escorted by the English and French governesses,
had gone down the town to transact all sorts of
mysterious business, chiefly in the confectionery
and perfumery line.  Two or three of them, and
these comprised the aristocracy of the school,
were paying visits in the close.  The chancellor's
daughters, who gave themselves airs, and were
consequently much petted by Miss Titheridge,
had gone down to the cathedral, and were
afterwards to drink tea at the Dean's, in company
with a niece of one of the minor canons, thereby
inspiring the remaining three and twenty young
ladies with secret envy.
</p>

<p>
Miss Titheridge sat in her snug little parlour
with the German governess, who was just then
the reigning favorite; Miss Titheridge, like most
autocrats, having always a favorite on hand,
who were always arbitrarily deposed at the first
symptom of independence.
</p>

<p>
The bright little French governess, Mademoiselle
La Roche, had long ago fallen into disgrace,
and the heavy-featured, stolid Fraulein Heimer
had taken her place.
</p>

<p>
It was a damp, chilly day in October; a clinging
mist pervaded the whole place; the leaves lay
in rotting heaps on the garden paths; the black
boughs of the almost leafless trees seemed to shiver
and creak in their bareness.
</p>

<p>
Inside the prospect was scarcely more cheering.
A small cindery fire burned drearily in the large
class-room, scarcely driving out the damp, which
seemed to settle everywhere, on the dim window-panes,
on the globes and bust of Pallas, making
Queenie shiver as she bent over the piles of slates
and exercises at one corner of the long table.
</p>

<p>
Across the hall she could hear now and then
the pleasant spluttering of logs and clink of
tea-spoons; a faint perfume, redolent of tea and
toast, was wafted across from the little room
where Miss Titheridge and the German governess
were sitting cosily in the twilight, with their
feet on the fender, and a plate of buttered muffins
between them.  An hour hence a tempting repast
of weak tea and thick bread and butter would
be dispensed to Miss Titheridge's young ladies, to
be enjoyed as only hungry school-girls can enjoy.
But Miss Titheridge was never present on these
occasions; her nerves required a certain amount
of quiet, and meditation towards the close of the
day was necessary to all thoughtful minds.  It
was a little odd that Miss Titheridge's meditations
were always accompanied by a mysterious
sound closely resembling somnolence.
</p>

<p>
As the dusk crept on, Queenie shivered and
sighed uneasily over her task; some harassing
thought evidently impeded progress.  By and by
she pushed the books impatiently from her, and
began pacing the room with quick, restless steps,
now and then pausing to rest her hot forehead
against the window-pane.
</p>

<p>
"Twice this week," she muttered at last, half
aloud.  "I must speak, whatever happens; and
yet if I should do harm?  I wish Cathy were
here; but no, we trouble her enough; I must act
on my own responsibility; I can do anything but
stand by and see it.  If I were only sure of
keeping my temper!"
</p>

<p>
Uttering these slightly incoherent sentences,
the young governess moved slowly to the door,
remaining there irresolutely a moment; and then,
with a sudden determination, walked quickly
across the passage, and knocked at the opposite
door.
</p>

<p>
"Who wants me at this unseemly hour?  Oh,
it is you of course, Miss Marriott," and Miss
Titheridge sat bolt upright, and glared stonily
at the culprit through her spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, she is always so inconsiderate, this
Meess," echoed the sympathizing Fraulein.
</p>

<p>
Miss Titheridge was a tall, masculine-looking
woman, with a spare figure and a Roman nose.
Why do strong-minded women invariably have
Roman noses?
</p>

<p>
She was not bad-looking, and was even reported
to have been handsome in her younger days, and
prided herself greatly on her deportment.  She
wore rich silk dresses, and her spectacles had gold
rims to them, and on state occasions she jangled
an appalling array of massive gold fetters on her
lean wrists.
</p>

<p>
Miss Caroline, on the contrary, had been a soft,
helpless woman, a great sufferer, and much
beloved by those who knew her.  During her
lifetime she had exercised a gentle influence on the
sterner sister.  It was noticed that Miss Titheridge
was not so hard or severe when Caroline
pleaded mercy.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask what is your errand, Miss Marriott?"
observed Miss Titheridge, dryly, and
with difficulty repressing a yawn, the long,
ivory-coloured hand moving ominously to the lips.
</p>

<p>
"It is about Emmie, Miss Titheridge,"
answered Queenie, hurriedly, "She did not mean
to be naughty, indeed, indeed she did not, only
the lesson was too difficult for so young a child."
</p>

<p>
"Was this the case, Fraulein?" demanded Miss
Titheridge, with a distrustful glance at the young
governess.
</p>

<p>
"Ach nein; Meess has not told the truth;
Meess had not given the class.  I believe the
little one is dull, stupid; does not, will not, do
preparation," and the heavy Teutonic face looked
obstinate and lowering.
</p>

<p>
Queenie absolutely loathed this woman, and
dreaded her as well.  Was she not the present
prime minister?  Miss Titheridge might have
relented; Fraulein never.  In vain would poor
Queenie protest, and beg off punishment for the
innocent little culprit.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, indeed Emmie is not stupid; she
was so bright, and learned so well; every one
told me so; but she is easily frightened.
Fraulein does not know how a word, a threat, scares
her.  The lesson was hard, and her head ached;
indeed she never meant to be inattentive."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott," returned Miss Titheridge,
severely, as Fraulein shrugged her shoulders with
a movement of dissent, "do you not know by
this time how useless it is to bring these sort of
complaints to me?  I never dispute Fraulein's
authority in such cases.  If Emmie were naughty
and inattentive, she must suffer the penalty of
her faults.  I am sorry," continued Miss Titheridge,
still more severely, "that I hear Emmie is
never otherwise than inattentive; she does no
credit to her teachers, or to my generosity."
</p>

<p>
The steady brown light in Queenie's eyes
burned ominously; it was evident that she controlled
herself with difficulty; the small, nervous
hands worked quickly.
</p>

<p>
"We only ask for justice.  Is it just," with an
inflexion of passion in her voice, "to shut up a
young child in a cold, dark room, without food
for hours, because she cannot do the task set her?
This is Emmie's only fault, Miss Titheridge."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott," returned Miss Titheridge, in
the freezing tone she used to refractory pupils,
"you are forgetting yourself.  Fraulein is witness
that you are forgetting yourself, and insulting
your benefactress.  No further words, I beg of
you, except in apology for your intemperate
speech.  Fraulein has sent Emmie to her room,
and there she must remain.  Please to return to
the duties you are at present neglecting," and
Miss Titheridge closed her lips rigidly, as though
with the determination to speak no more.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Queenie hesitated; a passionate
impulse came in the young girl's heart, a longing
to tell the women before her what she thought of
them, to pour out some of the scorn she felt for
their cruelty and littleness, and then, shaking off
the dust from that hated place, take her little
sister by the hand and go forth into the wide
world to seek their fortunes.
</p>

<p>
Queenie's better judgment triumphed over
these wild feelings; it would only be preparing
new miseries and fresh privations for Emmie to
take such a step; they must endure a little
longer.  She did not dare trust herself to speak,
but silently left the room.

CATHY.

  "She loved me for the dangers I had passed,<br>

<p class="intro2">
  "Something unseen o'er all her form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did nameless grace impart;<br>
  A secret charm, that won the way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once into the heart."&mdash;<i>Rev. John Logan.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Solitary confinement was a favorite mode of
punishment at Granite Lodge; visits of
condolence from sympathizing friends were sternly
interdicted.  Nevertheless, many small culprits
had been much comforted by peppermint lozenges
or acid drops, surreptitiously conveyed to them in
small screws of whitey-brown paper lowered down
to the window.  Notes hidden in the centre of
a large currant-bun had even been forwarded to
the unhappy prisoner; indeed, to carry provisions
to the incarcerated victim was one of the chief
amusements in the school.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Emmie was not a general favorite,
and no relief parties had as yet charged up the
garret stairs; no odd-shaped parcels had been
smuggled under black silk aprons, and passed on
by sleight of hand under Miss Titheridge's very
nose; nevertheless, comfort was close at hand.
</p>

<p>
As Queenie closed the door of the little parlour
she could hear the voices of the girls in the
lower entry.  There was not a moment to be lost
if she wished to elude discovery.  As she sped
up the broad stone staircase she could hear the
harsh, rebuking tones of Miss Tozer, the English
governess, with her favorite "Silence, young
ladies, if you please; no infringement of the
rules can be permitted."
</p>

<p>
Queenie knew well what she would see as
she opened the garret door&mdash;the line of stooping
shoulders against the light, the childish figure
cowering down on the high, broad window-ledge;
but she was hardly prepared for the words that
greeted her.
</p>

<p>
"I am not a bit afraid; I have said my prayers
twice over; but I sha'n't open my eyes till you
speak."
</p>

<p>
"Em, darling, what do you mean?" exclaimed
her sister, much startled.  "Why it is only I,
only Queenie."
</p>

<p>
A gasp and long-drawn sigh of relief answered
her, and then a pair of cold arms were thrown
delightedly round her neck, and a still colder
cheek laid against her own.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you dear old thing to come to me.  However
did you manage it, with the Ogre and the
Griffin at home?" by which delightful sobriquets
Miss Titheridge and Fraulein were often designated.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind how I managed it; I was determined
to see you for a moment.  I shall not be
able to stop; the gong will sound for tea directly.
Tell me what you meant just now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was nonsense; you will be angry with
me," returned Emmie, in a queer, ashamed voice,
but nevertheless creeping closer to her sister.
</p>

<p>
"Am I ever angry with you, darling?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, never," vehemently; "only of course
you must think it silly."
</p>

<p>
"What if I do?" with reassuring calmness.
</p>

<p>
"At twelve years old one ought to be wiser,"
returned poor Emmie, in a self-convicted tone.
"Of course I knew there was no old man wrapped
in a cloak in that corner, only it was so dark,
and Jane had forgotten to bring me a candle,
and the stairs would creak, and there was such
a funny noise, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Em, Em!" exclaimed her sister, in such
a troubled voice that the child could only hang
about her fondly, and promise not to be so silly
any more.
</p>

<p>
"It was so wrong and foolish of me," continued
Emmie, penitently, "after all the beautiful stories
you have told me about guardian angels; but I
suppose I am wicked because I can't bear the
dark; and when there is a great silence I always
seem to hear voices like little men underground,
talking and laughing in a muffled sort of way;
oh, such funny little voices, only they are not
quite nice."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Emmie, do you know this is quite
absurd," returned her sister, suppressing I know
not what pangs of pity and fond terror, and
trying to speak firmly.  "I wonder what mamma
would say if she knew her little girl were such
a coward, and thought such foolish things.  I
don't think we ought to be afraid in the
darkness which God has made," continued Queenie,
whose healthy young vitality knew none of the
mysterious terrors that afflict weaker and more
imaginative temperaments.  "And then we are
never alone, dear, never in any sense of the word.
I am sure our good guardian spirit would never
be allowed to leave us for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"It would be nice if one saw the angel,"
replied the child, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow we must have faith, dear.  I am
afraid your head has ached terribly over those
horrid lessons."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it has been pretty bad," in a patient
voice.
</p>

<p>
"And you are cold; oh, so cold, Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"I got the creeps, you know, and that always
makes me cold; but I can bear that," stoically.
</p>

<p>
"The meat was burnt, and so you had hardly
any dinner, and now Miss Titheridge says you
must have no tea; you must be starved,
absolutely starved," continued poor Queenie, rocking
her in her strong young arms.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite, I only feel rather sick," returned
the little prisoner, bravely.
</p>

<p>
Emmie would not have confessed for worlds
the odd gnawing and emptiness that preceded
her feelings of sickness.  She was somewhat
dainty and fastidious with regard to food, and
the burnt flavor had so nauseated her that she
had literally eaten nothing of the portion sent
her.  No wonder she had the creeps, as she
phrased it in her childish way, and she was
shivering with cold and superstitious terror.
</p>

<p>
"You are making me miserable," returned
Queenie, in a broken voice.  "I am punished as
well as you, Emmie.  Are you sure that you
really attend in class?  Fraulein declares that
you never know your lessons."
</p>

<p>
"I wish Miss Titheridge would not insist on
my learning that tiresome German," sighed
Emmie.  "She wants me to keep up with May
Trever.  May is ever so much stupider than
I," continued Em, with no special regard to
grammar; "but Fraulein never raps her over
the knuckles with a ruler, or gives her disgrace
tickets."
</p>

<p>
"Because May Trever is a canon's daughter,"
returned her sister, bitterly.  "She is not poor,
or friendless, or an orphan&mdash;three sins for which
we must answer.  But tell me truly, do you try
your hardest to please Fraulein?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, I do indeed," protested the child,
earnestly.  "Sometimes I know my lesson quite
perfectly, and then, when she looks at me with
those hard steel eyes, and comes out with that
sharp 'Now, little Meess, now,'"&mdash;with a faint,
dreary attempt at mimicry,&mdash;"it all goes out of
my head; and then the mark is put down, and I
go on from bad to worse.  I don't think I am
really stupid, Queenie, but I am afraid I shall
get so."
</p>

<p>
"No, you shall not; you must not," with a
shower of healing kisses on the little careworn
face.  "Hark! there's the gong, Emmie; I must
go."
</p>

<p>
"Must you?" in a dreary voice; and then
followed a heavy sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, darling.  You shall not be
long alone.  Miss Titheridge and Fraulein are
going out to spend the evening, and I shall tell
Miss Tozer that I have a headache, and must
retire early.  It will be quite true, you know.
Go to bed now, and try to forget that you are
cold and hungry; and then I will come up, and
we will have a long, beautiful talk about the
cottage, and Caleb, and all sorts of nice things.
You won't fret any more, Emmie?"
</p>

<p>
"No-o-o," hesitatingly; but two very large
tears rolled down the thin cheeks when the door
closed behind her comforter.  "Oh dear, oh
dear," sobbed the child; "I should not like her
to know how cold and hungry I am.  I think I
could eat a great hunch of dry bread if Jane
would bring it me; but she is such a cross old
thing, and I know she won't.  I wish I had
asked Queenie to hide a piece of bread and butter
for me.  Cathy did one day, and spoiled her
pretty new dress, because the butter would not
come out.  It is half-holiday, or else Cathy
would have come up long ago.  One time she
brought me a Bath bun, and it was so good.  I
wonder if Queenie would think me wicked if I
asked for something nice to eat in my prayers?
No; I don't think it would be wicked, for I have
not had my 'daily bread' yet."
</p>

<p>
Even the sour-tempered Miss Tozer relented
with womanly compassion when she saw Queenie's
pale face and heavy eyes.  The girl could eat
nothing.  The hot weak tea seemed to choke
her.  The touch of the little cold hands and face
seemed to haunt her.  "Cruel, cruel," she
muttered once between her teeth.  Her hands
clenched each other under the table-cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Emmie in disgrace again?  Dear, dear, this
is very sad.  I hope all you young ladies will
take example, and be more careful with your
preparation," observed Miss Tozer, sententiously.
"Miss Marriott, I should recommend a little soda
and salvolatile.  I always find it an excellent
remedy for a sick-headache."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be glad if you can dispense with my
services an hour earlier tonight," returned
Queenie, hastily.  "I think rest will be better
even than salvolatile, thank you all the same."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please," returned Miss Tozer,
frigidly.  Prescriptions were her hobby, and woe
to the offender who refused the proffered remedy.
But at Queenie's imploring glance she melted
into something like good-nature.  "Well, you
had better try both.  I am afraid the themes
must be corrected, unless you finished them this
afternoon.  I have pressing letters awaiting my
attention this evening."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; they shall be done," responded
Queenie, wearily.
</p>

<p>
After all, it was not so much her head as her
heart that ached.  She went back to her old
corner in the class-room, and worked away at the
girls' blotted themes, while they sat round her
whispering and laughing over their preparation.
</p>

<p>
It was not a cheerful scene.  The two long
deal tables were somewhat dimly lighted by
oil-lamps, which at times burnt low and emitted
unpleasing odours.  A governess sat at the head
of each table, busied over writing or fancy-work.
An occasional "Silence, young ladies," in Miss
Tozer's grating voice, alternated with Mademoiselle's
chirping "Taisez vous, mes chères demoiselles,"
followed by momentary silence, soon broken
by a titter.  One of the girls, indeed, did not
join in either the whispers or the titters, but
worked on steadily, and to some purpose, for, to
the surprise of her companions, she closed her
books long before the allotted hour, and, with an
explanatory mention to Miss Tozer about tidying
her drawers, left the room unseen by Queenie.
</p>

<p>
She was a tall girl, with an odd, characteristic
face, colorless complexion, and bright dark eyes.
She wore her hair in singular fashion, parted on
one side, and brushed even over her forehead in a
long wave, and simply knotted behind.
</p>

<p>
Most people called Catherine Clayton plain,
but to those who loved her this want of beauty
was redeemed by an excessive animation, and by
an expression of amiability and <i>bon-hommie</i> that
irresistibly attracted.
</p>

<p>
Her figure was erect and striking.  She walked,
ran, and danced equally well.  Movement was a
necessity to her; in some moods repose was
impossible.  In her gestures she had the freedom
and unconscious dignity of a young Indian squaw.
</p>

<p>
Catherine, or Cathy, as she was generally called
by her intimate friends, had struck up a warm
friendship with Queenie on the first day they met.
Queenie's strange eyes drew her like magnets;
their troubled pathos stimulated curiosity and
invited pity.  Queenie's pride and independence,
her quiet reserve, only charmed the younger
girl.
</p>

<p>
Cathy made swift advances, but they were only
repelled by the sad-looking young governess.
Cathy, nothing daunted, turned her attention to
Emmie, and won her heart in a trice, and from
that moment Queenie succumbed.
</p>

<p>
When Queenie loved, she loved with her whole
heart; half measures were impossible; she must
give entire confidence, or none at all.  Her
reserve, once broken through, was broken for
ever.  She soon made her friends acquainted with
the chequered story of her past life.  She told
Cathy the absolute blank of the future was
perfectly appalling to her.
</p>

<p>
Cathy listened and pitied, and started all sorts
of vague Utopian schemes that should ameliorate
the condition of her favorites.
</p>

<p>
Her own life had no bitter background.  She
was indeed a motherless orphan, but she was so
very young when her parents died that the cloud
had hardly shadowed her.  She spoke of them
affectionately, as of some dear unknown friends.
</p>

<p>
Queenie knew all about Cathy's home&mdash;the dull
old house at Hepshaw, overlooking the churchyard
and the plane-tree walk.  She had even
pictured to herself the granite quarries, where
Garth Clayton spent long hard-working
days.
</p>

<p>
Cathy was never weary of talking about Garth.
She would expatiate for hours on his virtues.
Was he not the stay and prop of the little
household?  Did not even Langley, the motherly
elder sister, go to him for advice and counsel?
The handsome younger brother, long, lazy Ted,
was spoken about more seldom.
</p>

<p>
"Ted is just Ted," Cathy would say sometimes,
in reply to Queenie's half quizzical
interrogations.  "A dear old fellow, of course; but he
cannot hold a candle to Garth.  Why Garth is a
perfect king in Hepshaw.  There is no one more
respected.  The work he does among the quarry-men
perfectly astonishes our new vicar.  He has
classes for them, and teaches them himself, and
plays cricket with them, and gets up
entertainments and lectures in the school-room.  Why,
the men perfectly adore him."
</p>

<p>
"How I should like to live at Hepshaw!"
Queenie would answer sometimes, sighing she
hardly knew why.
</p>

<p>
Cathy's descriptions somehow fascinated her
oddly.  The little straggling market town, with
its long, winding street or road; the old
Deerhound Inn; the white workhouse, the church
and vicarage, standing high, and overlooking the
town, and set prettily among plane trees; the
dark old 'Church-stile House,' with its gloomy
entry, and back windows looking over the ancient
monuments and tomb-stones&mdash;Queenie could see
them all.  She could even fancy herself walking
up the steep, narrow garden of the Vicarage,
between tall bushes of roses and lavender.
</p>

<p>
"The Vicarage is such an ugly, bare-looking
little house; quite a shabby cottage; only
Mr. Logan has made it so comfortable, and has
added a room to it, such a nice room, which he
has made out of the stable.  I think you would
like Mr. Logan, Queenie; he is quite old, nearly
forty, I should think.  People say he is very
plain, but I think he has a nice, funny face; and
he is such a character, and wears such old,
patched coats, and Miss Cosie always calls him
Kit, or 'Christopher, my dear.'"
</p>

<p>
"And who might Miss Cosie be?" Queenie
asked, with an amused air; she dearly loved
Cathy's descriptions.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Cosie was Charlotte Logan; she was
his sister, and kept his house.  Every one called her
Miss Cosie, even the poor people; it was a name
she got when a child."  No, she could not describe
her; she was a little woman with two big brown
curls pinned to her face, and she always wore a
soft grey Shetland shawl, and cooed out her words
in a soft, plaintive fashion; she only wished
Queenie could see her, and then Queenie sighed
again.
</p>

<p>
These sort of conversations fascinated Queenie;
Cathy's girlish egotism never wearied her.  Garth
Clayton was almost as great a hero to her as he
was in his sister's eyes; she had never heard of
such a man.  How good he must be!  She used to
try to picture him to herself.  "Garth is tall
and good-looking; every one likes his face," was
Cathy's somewhat vague description.  Queenie
used to long to hear more.
</p>

<p>
His handwriting was quite familiar to her; she
often admired the firm, clear characters when
Cathy read aloud amusing passages from his
letters.
</p>

<p>
How Queenie longed for such a brother!  Such
a manly, protecting tenderness breathed in every
line: in his injunctions to his dear little Catherine
not to be homesick or neglect her studies, in his
playful hints or merry descriptions of the friends
and pets she had left.
</p>

<p>
"Your parrot is inconsolable, and shrieks
disconsolately in our ears from morning to night,
much to Langley's annoyance," he wrote once.
"Ted threatens to wring its neck.  I am quite
sorry for the poor thing, and I believe it
understands my sympathy, for it sidles up to me and
looks at me with yellow, lack-lustre eyes, as much
as to say, 'Where's our Cathy, old fellow?' and
then clambers up my coat sleeve with beak and
claw, and settles itself on my shoulder to be
petted, which I suppose I do for your sake, and
because poor Polly has no other friend."
</p>

<p>
"There, is not that like him?" Cathy cried,
with sparkling eyes.  "He is always so good to
any helpless creature; he has sympathy even with
my poor Polly.  Mr. Logan always says unhappiness
or poverty is a sure passport to Garth's
heart."
</p>

<p>
"How sorry he would be for Emmie and me,"
thought poor Queenie, but she did not put her
thoughts into words.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE FEAST IN THE GARRET.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "We fell to work and feasted like the gods,<br>
  Like laborers, or like eager workhouse folk<br>
  At Yule-tide dinner; or, to say the whole<br>
  At once, like tired, hungry, healthy youth."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jean Ingelow.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Queenie, absorbed in the themes she was
correcting, was not aware of Cathy's absence from
the room.
</p>

<p>
As she toiled on, correcting faulty grammar
and replacing obnoxious terms, she was consumed
with terrible anxiety.  Emmie's thin white
face came between her and the page.  "What
can I do to save her from this life?" was her one
inward ejaculation.
</p>

<p>
She rose quite exhausted with the mental
strain when her work was finished.  The great
stone hall with its one lamp looked dreary enough
as she traversed it; all manner of weird shadows
lurked in the corners of the landing-place.  A
rising wind moaned in the ivy outside, and shook
the bare branches of the trees till they creaked
under it; the moon slid wildly through the
black clouds.  Queenie thought of Emmie with
a little shiver of apprehension, and hurried
on.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am.  Are you tired of waiting for me?"
she exclaimed, in a tone of enforced cheerfulness,
almost before she opened the door; and then she
started back, and a little cry of surprise and
pleasure broke from her lips at the changed
aspect of the garret.
</p>

<p>
The scene was certainly unique.
</p>

<p>
The rickety table, covered with an old red
shawl of Queenie's, was drawn close to the bed;
two candles, one green and the other yellow,
burnt cheerily in two broken medicine bottles;
a few late-blooming roses in a soap-dish gave an
air of elegance to the whole.  A bottle of ginger
wine, and various delicacies in the shape of meat
pies, tarts, and large sticky Bath buns, were
tastefully arranged at intervals, flanked by a pocket
corkscrew, a pen-knife, tumbler, and small tin
plate.
</p>

<p>
Emmie, propped up with pillows and huddled
up in a warm plaid belonging to Cathy, regarded
this magnificent feast with bright-eyed astonishment;
she clapped her hands at the sight of her
sister.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queenie, I am so glad you have come.
Everything is ready now, only Cathy has gone
down to fetch something; she has been planning
this delightful surprise all day.  Is it not kind of
her?"
</p>

<p>
"Listeners never hear any good of themselves,
so I had better make my appearance," interposed
a laughing voice, at which Queenie turned hastily
round.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cathy, Cathy, whatever should we do
without you!" she cried, looking gratefully at
her friend.
</p>

<p>
Cathy's eyes grew a little moist, and then she
broke into a low musical laugh delicious to hear.
</p>

<p>
"Have I not done it well?" rocking herself
with merriment.  "Not a creature suspects
anything.  I shall go down presently and pretend
to eat supper.  Are not those candles lovely,
Queenie? they make this dismal old room quite
cheerful.  There, wrap yourself up in my
sealskin, while I help Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it lovely!" sighed Emmie, in a tone of
such heartfelt happiness, that Cathy hugged her
on the spot.  The cakes, the meat pie, the ginger
wine seemed enchanted food to her; the roses,
the colored candles, were perfectly radiant in
her eyes.  "It is just like a fairy story.  You are
our good fairy, Cathy," she cried; "I am sure I
love you next best in the world to Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"How I wish Garth could see us!" laughed
Cathy.  She had enveloped herself in an old grey
plaid, and had put one of the roses in her hair,
and with her dark hair and eyes looked not
unlike a gipsy.  "Langley would be dreadfully
shocked, but Garth would laugh first and lecture
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"You are always talking about Garth; I wish
I could see him," sighed Emmie.  "You never
make us see him, Cathy."
</p>

<p>
Cathy pondered a moment.  "It is not easy to
describe people with whom you live; one is afraid
of being too much prejudiced in their favor.  I
don't think I am wrong in calling Garth handsome,
because every one says so."
</p>

<p>
"Every one is sure to be right," put in Queenie,
quietly.  She did not like to betray her interest,
but she had always longed to be able to picture
Garth.  "He is tall," she hazarded, rather
timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, tall and fine-looking.  He is eight-and-twenty,
you know: he has a nice thoughtful face,
rather pale; and his mouth is very firm, and shuts
tightly, only the moustache hides it; and his eyes
are blue-grey, just the colour I like for a man, and
they look kind and gentle; and then he looks
so good, as though he could never do anything
wrong or mean.
</p>

<p>
"He must be a nice man," exclaimed Emmie,
enthusiastically.  "Then he is not like you,
Cathy?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she returned, regretfully; "Langley
and I are alike, only Langley is older and
worn-looking; she is two years older than Garth, just
thirty in fact, quite an old maid," continued the
girl of eighteen, in a tone of profound pity.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think people of thirty ought to be
considered quite middle-aged," remonstrated
Queenie, who had long ago achieved her
twentieth year.
</p>

<p>
"Not some people perhaps, but Langley
looks dreadfully old; one can't tell how it was
that she was considered so handsome.  Her
features are good, but she looks so thin and worn,
and she is paler than I am, and her hair is
turning grey.  Langley is very nice, and good
to us all, but I sometimes think that she leads
too dull a life; Garth often says so.  I know he
will be glad that I am to go home next quarter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cathy, however shall we be able to
endure this place without you?" interposed her
friend.
</p>

<p>
Emmie had waxed drowsy with comfort, and
was dozing placidly, and the two girls had
curled themselves up for warmth on the bed.
Cathy had disappeared for a short time, and had
come back with the announcement that the Ogre
and Griffin were still out, and the other
governesses at supper.
</p>

<p>
"My having a bedroom to myself makes it
easier to evade rules," explained Cathy.  "I have
put the bolster and some clothes in the bed, and
drawn the counterpane well over them, and
Mademoiselle will just peep in and think I am
asleep.  Oh, what fun it is!  How many suppers
have we had in this old garret?"
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon have seen the last of them,"
returned Queenie, sorrowfully.  "I can't bear to
think of your going away."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Queen!" responded her friend,
affectionately.  "It is very sad, leaving you and
Emmie behind in this mouse-trap of a place.
When I go home I mean to talk to Garth and
Langley about you.  Langley is so good, she is
sure to invite you and Emmie for the summer
holidays."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cathy, do you think so? do you really
think so?" and Queenie almost gasped with
surprise and joy.  To take Emmie into the country
again, to see the little pinched face grow round
and blooming in the fine moorland air, to watch
her gathering wild-flowers, or scrambling through
woods, could it ever come true?  For the first
moment Queenie forgot everything but her little
sister; the next her cheek flushed crimson&mdash;she
would see Cathy's home and Garth.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really, really think it will come true?"
</p>

<p>
"True! of course it will.  Garth and Langley
never refused me anything, and when I tell them
about you and Emmie they will be wild to know
you.  What walks we will have!  I must show
you Hepshaw Abbey, and I must bribe Garth
to drive us to Karlsmere; it is such a lovely
lake.  And then we can go and see the King of
Karldale."
</p>

<p>
"See whom?" inquired Queenie, in some perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a friend of ours, who is called by that
name; he is a gentleman farmer, and lives near
the head of the lake.  His real name is Harry
Chester, but he is always called the King of
Karldale.  I am very fond of Harry."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," with a slight stress.
</p>

<p>
"He is such a dear good fellow.  I wish I
could like his wife half as well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is married," with a shade of
disappointment in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Married! very much so, poor fellow, and I
don't think he quite likes it.  She does not exactly
henpeck him, but she is a fine lady, and worries
him into doing things he does not like, such as
taking her to Paris, and giving her expensive
dresses.  I am afraid she spends a great deal too
much money, and that troubles Harry."
</p>

<p>
"He should keep her in order then."
</p>

<p>
"I think he tries; but Gertrude has a will of
her own.  She frets if he refuse to humour her,
and as she is very delicate, and the doctors look
very gravely at her sometimes, he is afraid not to
give her her way.  He sometimes talks to Langley,
and she always takes Gertrude's part; why I
don't know, for no one else likes her."
</p>

<p>
"How nice to know people, and to get interested
in their lives," sighed the poor recluse.
"You have made me quite long to know all
the people in your neighbourhood, especially
Mr. Logan and his sister."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Miss Cosie, how she will pet you; and
you will be great friends with Mr. Logan.  Do
you know," in a puzzled voice, "I don't seem to
get on with Mr. Logan as well as I did; he gave
me lectures last holidays, and I became a little
shy of him."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you are not one to mind any amount
of scolding."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, when I don't care about the
people who give the scolding; but that is just it.
Mr. Logan looks at one so benevolently, and yet
his eyes seem to read you through and through;
and then he goes on in that mild voice of his,
till Miss Catherine, as he calls her, either makes
a fool of herself or runs out of the room."
</p>

<p>
"But he has no right to lecture you," indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, has he not!" sighed Cathy, and the
dark, brilliant eyes looked very serious for a
moment.  "He says we girls at the present day have
such a low standard of right that we never rise
above medium goodness, and are too easily
satisfied with ourselves.  He is always saying we
have no great saints now-a-days, and that there
can be no St. Augustines without Monicas."
</p>

<p>
"It is very true."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is such a good man, he makes one
feel ashamed of one's self.  When he talks one
forgets his patched coat and plain face and bald
head.  I used to laugh when he pushed his spectacles
up in that droll way, but somehow nothing
seems odd about him now."
</p>

<p>
"And he is not married?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he is an old bachelor, and Miss Cosie
keeps his house.  I don't think he has ever
been in love; Miss Cosie said so one day; he
has never been able to find a woman with a
sufficiently high standard, I suppose.  Even Langley
would not suit him, though I believe he thinks
very highly of her; they have such long, serious
talks.  Queenie, do you recollect remarking one
day that I never used slang now?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he cured me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can comprehend the purport of the lectures now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he gravely remonstrated with me one
day.  'Miss Catherine,' he once said, 'does it
never strike you to inquire if the high-born ladies
of old time ever talked slang?'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope you answered him properly."
</p>

<p>
"No, I was very saucy; I told him I had no
doubt they were often 'awfully jolly,' and were
fast and slow and spoony no end like other
people, and some of the men dreadful duffers and
cads."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, how could you?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, it was the last outburst.  Before
an hour was over I was fairly crushed, and took
a private vow never to utter anything but the
purest English ever afterwards.  It was very hard
at first, and I had to inflict dreadful pinches
on myself, and put endless pennies in the poor's
box, before I could remember; but I am cured since."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and it is such an improvement; I feel
very much obliged to Mr. Logan."
</p>

<p>
"I took my revenge though," returned Cathy,
looking a little guilty; "I went away without
bidding him good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"That was hardly kind."
</p>

<p>
"So he said.  I was very remorseful, and wrote
him a penitent little note a week afterwards.
The letter I got in return made me feel very small."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say he forgave you."
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Saint Christopher, I know he did;
but he was terribly hurt; Langley told me so.
I often think we are 'old men of the mountain'
to ourselves.  How one longs sometimes to throw
off one's self and one's faults!"
</p>

<p>
"You have less than any one I know," returned
Queenie, who had a warm admiration for the
daring and generous-hearted girl.
</p>

<p>
"You are wrong," returned Cathy, humbly;
"Mr. Logan knows me best.  I do want to be
true, as true as I know how to be.  I think I
hate conventional shams as much as he does; it
is this want of truth in the world that appals
one."
</p>

<p>
"And the lack of kindness," put in Queenie,
who had seen the darker side of human nature.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed there is plenty of kindness in the
world.  You have grown misanthropic with hard
usage; you will change your mind when you
come among us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you must make allowances for me," she
said, somewhat sadly; "I have been too much in
contact with coarse, selfish minds to judge
leniently.  Cathy, how can women be so censorious
to their own sex? how can they oppress and
grieve a little child in the way Miss Titheridge
and Fraulein oppress Emmie?"
</p>

<p>
"It is too bad; but I think Miss Titheridge is
obtuse; she does not understand Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Do you not think she is changed?" whispered
Queenie, with a glance at the sleeping child.
"She has grown thinner and paler, and her eyes
are so hollow.  Caleb noticed it last week."
</p>

<p>
"She is growing, and needs care," was the
compassionate answer, as Cathy rose and folded
the shawl closer round the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
"Care! that is just what she does not get.
Oh, Cathy, I think poor mamma would have
broken her heart if she had known what was in
store for us; she was so fond of Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dear," for Queenie had covered her
face with her hands, and was weeping bitterly
now.  "We will not talk any more; you are weary
and over-tasked.  You are very brave, my Queen,
and seldom break down, but you are too tired to
cry to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is wrong of me, but yet it has done
me good," she whispered, after a short interval.
</p>

<p>
They were still sitting together, hand in hand.
The green candle had burnt out, but the pink one
still burnt cheerily; one or two of the roses had
withered; the fragments of the feast still reposed
on the old red shawl; the moonbeams stole
through the uncurtained window, and played fitfully
on the uneven floor; a little pale face slept
peacefully under the old wrapper.
</p>

<p>
By and bye, when Cathy had left her, Queenie
lay down, and drew the warm, sleeping child to
her arms.  The moon had come out from behind
the clouds now; the stream of pale, silvery light
flooded the room; a perfect halo shone round
Emmie's fair hair.  Queenie shivered, and gave a
faint sob as she saw it.
</p>

<p>
"She is paler and thinner," she said to herself.
"Cathy noticed it, and so did Caleb.  They are
killing her by inches, and yet they will not see;
they are straining her mind and body, and neither
will bear it.  Oh, mamma, mamma, she would be
better off with you; but I cannot spare her, I
cannot spare Emmie!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you awake, Queenie?  Oh, I have had
such a beautiful dream.  I was in a strange place,
and mamma came to me, looking so kind, just
like her old self, only grander; I think she had
a crown on her head; and she took me in her
arms and kissed me, just as she used to do, and
told me to be good and patient, and to do as
you told me, and that she loved us both."
</p>

<p>
Sleep on, little comforter, in the arms that hold
you so lovingly.  The strain is lessened, the weary
oppression gone.  The child's dream, so lovingly
told, has brought healing to the weary sister.
The unseen guardian watched over them both,
the message of love had come to her too, and in
this fond belief Queenie fell asleep.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
CALEB RUNCIMAN.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,<br>
  A mere, mere woman, a mere flaccid nerve,<br>
  A kerchief left all night in the rain,<br>
  Turned soft so&mdash;over-tasked and over-strained<br>
  And over-lived in this close London life!<br>
  And yet I should be stronger."&mdash;<i>Aurora Leigh.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One wet evening, towards the end of November,
Caleb Runciman stood at the window of his
little parlor, straining his eyes wistfully into the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"A wild night," he muttered to himself more
than once; "it is raining whole buckets-full, and
blowing hard.  She will never venture out with
the child, and so careful as she is too, bless her
dear little motherly heart.  I may as well tell
Molly to make the tea.  Dear, dear, how contrary-wise
things will happen sometimes," with which
oracular remark the old man rubbed his hands
ruefully together, and turned to the fire.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild night certainly.  A cold, gusty
rain swept the streets of Carlisle; the flickering
lamplight shone on glittering pools and dripping
water-spouts; the few pedestrians hurried past
Caleb's window, casting furtive glances at the
warm, inviting gleam from within.
</p>

<p>
Caleb's fire blazed cheerily; a faggot spluttered
and hissed half up the little chimney; the blue
china pixies on the old-fashioned tiles fairly
danced in the light, as did the Dresden
shepherdesses, and the two simpering figures in
umbrella courtship on the high wooden mantel-piece.
</p>

<p>
These tiles were Emmie's delight.  She would
sit on the stool at Caleb's feet for hours,
following the innocent, baby-faced pixy through a
hundred fanciful adventures.  The little gentleman
in the pink china waistcoat and the lady
in the blue scarf were veritable works of art to
her.  The plaster group of the Holy Family,
slightly defaced by smoke and time, excited in
her the same profound reverence that a Titian or
a Raphael excites in an older mind.  She never
could be made to understand that the black-framed
battle of Trafalgar, painted in flaming
reds and yellows, was not a master-piece; there
was nothing incongruous to her in the spectacle
of Nelson's dying agonies portrayed amid the
stage effects of a third rate pantomime; to her
the ludicrous was merged in the sublime.  It is
not in early youth that the one trends so often
on the other.
</p>

<p>
The candlesticks on the little round table were
still unlighted, but there was plenty of light to
show signs of unwonted preparations.  Caleb had
robbed the plot of ground he called his garden
ruthlessly before he filled the large, wide-mouthed
jug with violet and white china asters.  The
display of preserves in all colors too, not to
mention an astounding plum-cake with frosted
edges, showed some unusual festivity.
</p>

<p>
Caleb's round rosy face elongated considerably
as he sat in his wooden rocking-chair, warming
his hands over the blaze.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear, she'll cry her eyes out, poor
lamb, and no wonder; and such a beautiful
cake too as Molly has made," he continued,
disconsolately.  "I wonder if the old cat would
open the parcel if I sent it wrapt up in brown
paper, with Caleb Runciman's kind regards to
Miss Emmie.  I'll lay a wager the poor little
angel would never eat a crumb of it.  Hark! surely
that was not a knock; I dare say it is
only the paper-boy."
</p>

<p>
Caleb's cogitations soon came to an abrupt end.
There was an exclamation of surprised dismay in
Molly's loud, cheerful voice, then quick footsteps,
and the entrance of two dripping figures.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Queenie and the precious
lamb, who ever would have thought it!" cried
Caleb, in a voice quite trembling with joy, but
shaking his head all the time.  "It will be the
death of both of you.  Molly!  Where is that
woman?  Molly, it will be the death of these
dear creatures if you don't make tea quick, and
get off their wet things.  Miss Queenie, I am
surprised at you.  Dear, dear, such a night.  I
must say I am surprised," continued Caleb,
trying to speak severely, but with his blue eyes
twinkling with animation.
</p>

<p>
"Emmie fretted so that I was obliged to bring
her," returned Queenie, apologetically.  "It was
wrong, I know; I have been blaming myself all
the way; but what could I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Caleb, don't be cross, and on my birthday
too," interrupted Emmie, throwing her arms
round the old man's neck.  "I thought of your
disappointment, and the cake, and the dear old
parlor, and I could not help crying; and then
Queenie put on her determined face, and said
I should go if she carried me.  Cathy was so
angry with us both, and no wonder."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; I must say I was extremely surprised,"
reiterated Caleb, who never liked to lose
a leading idea, and was fond of repeating his
own words.  "Mark my words, Miss Queenie, it
will be the death of Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Caleb," interrupted the child;
"I won't have you scold Queenie; she carried
me nearly all the way, she did indeed; she
said I was quite light.  And she is so tired,
and she made me wear her cloak, because it
was long, and would cover me, and I am so
warm and dry; but I know her poor feet
are wet, because her boots are so thin and old,
terribly old."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush, Em; how can you?" returned her
sister, blushing hotly; "you will make Caleb so
unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"You both of you go near to break my heart,"
replied the old man huskily, as he knelt down,
and took the old shabby boot in his hand.
"Miss Queenie, dear, this is not right; you will
lay yourself up, and then what will Emmie do?
Where is the money I gave you last time you
were here, when I begged and prayed you to get
a new pair?"
</p>

<p>
"She bought ever so many things for me,"
broke in Emmie again.  "No, I won't hush,
Queenie," as her sister vainly strove to silence
her.  "I said I would tell Caleb, and I will.  I
have warm flannels, and gloves, and mittens, and
Queenie has nothing; and she is so cold that she
never gets warm all day; and Cathy says it is a
shame."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Queenie, Miss Queenie," was all
Caleb's answer, as the old fingers fumbled and
bungled over their work.  Perhaps it was an
unusually large pinch of snuff that dimmed his
eyes for a moment, and that obliged him to have
recourse to the red spotted silk handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was used to be waited upon by her
kind old friend.  She allowed her cold feet to be
encased in a pair of list slippers that Molly had
made for Caleb.  A pleasant feeling of warmth
and comfort began to steal over her, a luxurious
sense of being cared for.  Emmie had already
installed herself at the tea-tray, and was holding
the tea-pot carefully with both hands; her work
was cut out for her for the evening.  She had to
make tea for Caleb and Queenie, and then fill
Caleb's pipe, and sit at his knee and chatter to
him of all they had been doing; then she had
to visit Molly in her nice clean kitchen, and play
with Sukey and her kittens.  How she longed
for a kitten in the old garret in Granite Lodge,
only Queenie shook her head at the bare idea.
</p>

<p>
To-night Molly was ironing her master's shirts,
and Emmie's visit was paid earlier than usual,
that she might help her by washing up the
tea-things, a piece of play-work that was charming
to the little girl.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had left them, Caleb put down
his pipe, and drew his chair closer to Queenie, and
laid his wrinkled hand on hers.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear, well! and how has the world
been treating you lately?" for the quiet, thoughtful
face he had been watching all the evening
seemed to him to have grown sadder since he
last saw it.
</p>

<p>
"You must not ask me, my dear old friend,"
returned the girl, sorrowfully; "I have been
losing heart lately."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, that's bad hearing."
</p>

<p>
"One must speak the truth.  I have lost not
only heart, but courage.  If it were not for
Emmie I could battle on; I am strong and tough
enough for anything, but she makes me weak."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, surely."
</p>

<p>
"Do not misunderstand me,"&mdash;as the kind old
hand stroked hers gently,&mdash;"I could not bear you
to do that.  I am weak, I do not complain, I am
young and healthy, and a little hardness will not
hurt me; but it is for Emmie I fear.  Caleb," in
an almost inaudible voice, "what they make me
suffer through her!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it, I know it," rubbing up his grey
hair restlessly.
</p>

<p>
"She is getting thinner every day, and losing
appetite, and there is a nervous look in her eyes
that I do not like.  Miss Titheridge will not see
it; I think sometimes she dislikes Emmie; she
and Fraulein are harder on her than ever."
</p>

<p>
"There now, there now, poor lambs, poor
orphaned lambs," broke in the compassionate
Caleb.
</p>

<p>
"They are driving me to the verge of distraction,
and they know it," continued Queenie, in
the same strange, suppressed voice; "things
cannot go on like this much longer.  Caleb, I shall
frighten you, but I have made up my mind to do
something desperate, and to do it at once: I
mean to go to Mr. Calcott."
</p>

<p>
Caleb's hands dropped on his knees, and his
eyes grew round and fixed.  "Miss Queenie!"
he gasped at length.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go to him," repeated the young girl
quietly, "and tell him about Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but he will never see you, my dear
young lady; you must be mad or dreaming.  See
Mr. Calcott! it is a preposterous
idea&mdash;preposterous&mdash;pre&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! when have you ever known me fail in
anything I have undertaken?  It is a waste of
words to try and dissuade me.  All last night I
lay thinking it out, till my brain reeled.  I may
do no good; heaven knows what manner of man
I have to deal with, but all the same I will speak
to him, face to face, and tell him what is in my
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven preserve the young creature, for she
is certainly daft!" groaned Caleb; and here he
positively wrung his hands.  "The lamb in the
lion's den, that is what it will be.  Miss Queenie,
dear," he said, coaxingly, "I am thirty or forty
years older than you; be guided by an old
friend, and put this thought out of your head."
</p>

<p>
Queenie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It will do no good to Emmie, and only anger
him against you both.  He is an old man now,
and ailing; and some say he suffers a good deal
at times, and then he gets almost beside himself.
You do not know to what you expose yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," finding the girl still remained silent,
"you may even turn him more against you.
Sometimes I have seen him start and bite his
lip when the school has passed our office window;
he never fails to recognise it, and he seems
disturbed and put out for minutes afterward.  You
see his sin lies heavy on him&mdash;the sin of those
wicked words, Miss Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I know," she interrupted hastily,
"and most likely he repents.  Caleb, it is useless;
nothing you can say will shake my resolution.
Things have come to this pass, that I would
rather beg my bread than be indebted any longer
to Miss Titheridge.  If we stay there Emmie
will die, and then what good will my life be to me."
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head reproachfully.
"Miss Queenie, you know what you have refused?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she returned, looking at him with a
smile that made her face absolutely beautiful,
"yes, dear old friend; but it was right.  You
were too old to work for us, too old to be
burthened with two such helpless creatures; and
then how were we to know whether Mr. Calcott's
anger might not have been turned on you.  Were
we to bring trouble on our only friend?"
</p>

<p>
"I said," continued Caleb in a broken
voice, "that as long as I had a crust of
bread and a cup of water, and a roof, however
humble, I would share them with you and
Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"And my answer," continued the girl softly,
as she lifted the wrinkled hand to her lips, "my
answer was that Emmie and I loved you too
well to bring sorrow and ruin on you.  Caleb,
Emmie is dearer to me than anything in the
world; but I would rather lose her than do such
a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you were always so proud and self-willed,"
ejaculated Caleb, sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am proud of my pride; I rejoice in a
self-will that prevents me from harming so deeply
one whom I love.  You have given us more
than crusts, you have shared with us a nobler
shelter than your roof, for you have warmed us
through and through with a kindness that has
known no stint or limit; and Emmie and I will
bless you for it all our lives."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, don't, Miss Queenie; I cannot bear
you to say such things."
</p>

<p>
"But I will say them, I must say them, when
you call me proud and self-willed; I must defend
myself, and get the last word; I am only a
woman, you know."
</p>

<p>
"God bless such women, I say."
</p>

<p>
"You have the spirit of a little child, Caleb;
so doubtless you will be heard.  Blessings are
long in coming to us I think, and I am growing
hard and discontented in consequence; but you
and Cathy have often saved me from hopeless
infidelity."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens! what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, from infidelity&mdash;that utter and hopeless
disbelief in one's fellow-creatures.  When I find
myself growing cynical, I just say, 'There are
Caleb and Cathy, the world cannot be wholly
bad with two such good creatures in it,' and that
thought rests me."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, it is too old a head on young
shoulders; people don't often think and say such
things.  You are rarely clever for your age, Miss
Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"One can think without being clever," returned
the girl, with a slight smile.  "Cathy and I have
strange talks sometimes; we often bewilder and
lose ourselves.  I have no one as Cathy has to
set me right.  It must be very nice to have a
brother."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, I had a brother once," returned Caleb,
dreamily; "he was deformed, poor fellow, a
hunch-back; but every one liked Joe.  I was only
a little chap when he died, but I have never
forgotten him yet; some of his sharp sayings
come into my mind when I sit here smoking my pipe."
</p>

<p>
"A strong, wise, elder brother,&mdash;some one to
trust,&mdash;and who would care for me," continued
Queenie, reflectively.  "I think Cathy must be a
happy girl.  Hark! that is nine striking; I must
go and find Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"I have ironed lots of handkerchiefs, all the
beautiful blue and white spotted ones," cried
Emmie, rushing in, red and glowing, "and Molly
has been telling me such lovely stories.  I think
Molly quite the handsomest woman I have ever
seen after Queenie, she is so nice and rosy."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Em, come," replied the elder sister,
quietly; "it is raining so fast, dear, and the
wind will blow you away unless you keep close
to me.  Bid Caleb good-night, and let us go."
</p>

<p>
"How dark and wet it is," cried poor Emmie,
as the door of her child's paradise closed behind
her, and the grey frowning portico of Granite
Lodge loomed on her distant vision.  "Oh,
Queenie, why must we not go and live with
Caleb, and leave this horrid, hateful prison of
ours?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, pet; shall I tell you a story? but
perhaps you cannot hear my voice in the wind.
What! tired, darling, already?  Suppose I carry
you again just for fun!  It is dark, and no one
will see us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just for fun," returned the child wearily;
"if you are not tired, Queenie.  Mind you put
me down when you are tired."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; you are so dreadfully heavy;"
but the little joke died away into something like
a sob as she lifted the thin, weak figure in her
strong young arms, and struggled bravely through
the storm.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
"YOU ARE EMMIE'S UNCLE!"
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "So speaking, with less anger in my voice<br>
  Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart."&mdash;<i>Curwen Leigh.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Queenie Marriott was right in asserting that
she never failed to undertake anything to which
she had really made up her mind.  Strong
impulses were rare with her; but now and then they
gained the mastery, and over-bore all dread of
opposing obstacles.  At such times the forces
of her mind lay dormant; argument could not
shake; persuasion, even conviction, availed
nothing.  In such moods Queenie was inexorable,
and triumphed in the exercise of her self-will.
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to lose in this matter, and all
to gain," she had said to Cathy.  On the afternoon
of the next half-holiday she had arrayed herself,
with the stoicism of a young Spartan, and, with
the help of feminine art and cunning arrangement,
had even given a certain style to her
shabby garments.
</p>

<p>
"No one could take you for anything but a
lady," Cathy said, as she watched her, half
curiously and half enviously; "when people look
at you they will not notice what you wear I
mean.  I wish I knew where you learnt
deportment, my dear Madam Dignity.  There," as
Queenie buttoned her old gloves with a resolute
air, "I cannot even lend you my pretty new
ones, they would be ever so much too large."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," returned Queenie with a smile;
"my plumes are homely, certainly, but they are
not borrowed.  Take care of Emmie for me, and
wish me good luck, for I am continually leading
the forlorn hope."
</p>

<p>
Queenie had preserved a gallant demeanor in
Granite Lodge, but she slackened her footsteps
and drew her breath a little unevenly when she
came in sight of Mr. Calcott's house, a large grey
stone building with dark outside shutters, and a
high portico over the gate resembling the entrance
to a tomb.  Queenie thought of the thin
austere-looking man who eyed their ranks so gloomily
with a sudden failure of courage and an ominous
beating in the regions of the heart; but the bell
was already ringing in strange hollow fashion,
and the next moment she was confronted by a
grey-haired butler.
</p>

<p>
"Does Mr. Calcott live here? could I see him
for a moment on business?"  It must be averred
that Queenie's voice was somewhat faint at this
juncture; the sombre hall, the morose face of the
man, a little daunted her.
</p>

<p>
"People on business always call at the office
down the town.  Mr. Calcott is not very well,
but Mr. Smiler or Mr. Runciman could see you,"
returned the man civilly enough, but with an
evident desire to close the door in her appealing
face.
</p>

<p>
"It is not exactly business, but my errand is
very pressing.  If he is not very ill I must see
him," pleaded Queenie with a desperation evoked
by emergency.
</p>

<p>
"My master does not see visitors when he is
suffering from gout," persisted the man, with a
pointed stress on the word visitors.  "I will take
your card if you like, but I fear it will be little
use."
</p>

<p>
"I have no card," faltered Queenie; "I do not
want to send my name, though he knows it well.
Please tell him a young lady wishes to speak to
him on a matter of great importance; tell him
how grateful I shall be if he will grant me a five
minutes' interview."
</p>

<p>
The man hesitated; but Queenie's face and
voice evidently pre-possessed him in her favour;
for after another glance he closed the door and
ushered her into a small waiting-room leading
out of the hall, with a cold, fireless grate, and
a horse-hair sofa and chairs placed stiffly against
the wall.  There was a picture of Strafford led
out to execution over the mantel-piece, which
somehow attracted Queenie oddly.  "Even the
anticipation must be worse than the reality," she
thought; "one is a coward before-hand.  Never
mind if I can only find words to tell him the
truth when the time comes.  I am not the first
who has to suffer for trying to do the right
thing."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was cheering herself up in sturdy
fashion, but she turned a little pale, nevertheless,
when the servant re-entered and bade her follow
him.  "The execution will soon be over," she
said to herself, as she rose; "only in my case
perhaps the pain will not cease."
</p>

<p>
They had passed through the large square hall,
dimly lighted from above, and had turned down
a side-passage shut in with red baize doors;
through one of these was an inner one, which the
servant threw open, and Queenie found herself
in a small room, furnished as a library, with a
bright fire burning in a steel grate, and a cushioned
chair beside it with a foot-rest, wherein sat a tall,
thin old man, whom she at once recognized as
Mr. Calcott.  There was an instant's silence as
she bowed and threw back her veil, during which
he eyed her morosely, and pointed to his foot
swathed in bandages.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot rise, you see," he said, in a harsh
voice that somewhat grated on her ear, "neither
can I keep a lady standing; please to be seated,
while you tell me to what I am indebted for the
pleasure of this interview; my servant says you
declined to give him your name."
</p>

<p>
"I had reasons for doing so.  I feared you
might not see me," returned Queenie, summoning
all her resolution now the opportunity was gained.
The hard mouth, the narrow, receding forehead,
and the cold, gray eyes of the man before her
stifled every dawning hope.  Would those eyes
soften? could those lines ever relax?  He was an
old man, older than she had thought, and there
were traces of acute physical suffering in his
face, but the hard tension of the muscles were
terrible.
</p>

<p>
"Would you have seen me," she continued,
steadily, "if I had said my name was Marriott?"
</p>

<p>
"So you are Frank Marriott's daughter," without
the faintest token of surprise.  "I must own
I suspected as much from Gurnel's description;
but I am slightly at a loss to discover what
business Frank Marriott's daughter can possibly have
with me."
</p>

<p>
"I have come on no business of my own,"
returned the girl, proudly.  "I ask nothing from
the world but the price of my own earnings.  I
would sooner starve"&mdash;with a sudden flush of
irrepressible emotion&mdash;"than ask a favor from
a stranger, even though he were the brother of
my own dear stepmother.  It is for Emmie's
sake I have come to you, Mr. Calcott; Emmie,
your own niece, your own flesh and blood, your
sister's child."
</p>

<p>
"I have always expected this," muttered
Mr. Calcott, as he refreshed himself with a pinch of
highly-scented snuff; but a closer observer of
human nature than Queenie would have detected
a slight trembling in the white wrinkled hand.
</p>

<p>
"When my dear stepmother, your sister, died,"
continued Queenie, speaking more calmly now,
"she called me to her bed-side, and prayed
me, for love of her, to watch over Emmie.  I
have kept my promise, and have done so;
but I am only young, not much more than
twenty, and I have no one to help me, no one
but Mr. Runciman, who is so good to us, to give
me advice and counsel; and now I feel that I
cannot do my duty to Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Your conduct has been estimable, no doubt;
but you must permit me to observe, my dear
young lady, that I have not invited this confidence;
on the contrary, it is distasteful to me.
But doubtless you are only acting on Mr. Runciman's
advice?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," interposed the girl eagerly;
"he tried to dissuade me from coming to you;
he seemed frightened when I proposed it; it is
my own thought; I am acting on my own
responsibility.  I said to myself, 'If he only
knows what Emmie suffers, how often she is cold
and hungry, and sad, he will do something to
make her poor life happier.'"
</p>

<p>
"My good young woman, no melodrama, if you
please.  I have all my life confined myself strictly
to facts.  Miss Titheridge's establishment for
young ladies is the most respectable in Carlisle.
I have heard much from my clients in her praise;
no one has ever before informed me that her
pupils are cold or half-starved&mdash;facts, if you
please, facts."
</p>

<p>
"I am speaking sober truth," returned Queenie,
coloring.  "I am one of Miss Titheridge's
governesses, and, as far as I can tell, her
pupils have no cause for complaint; it is only
Emmie."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Calcott shook his head incredulously, and
took another pinch of snuff, this time somewhat
irritably.
</p>

<p>
"I work for my own and Emmie's board," she
went on, "and we pay a few pounds besides&mdash;all
that we can spare.  I do not complain for myself
that the accommodation is bad and the food
insufficient, though it is so for a growing child; but
the food is such that Emmie cannot eat it, and
often and often I have seen her cry from sheer
cold and misery."
</p>

<p>
"Tut, some children will be fretful&mdash;aye, and
dainty too."
</p>

<p>
"Emmie is bred up in too hard a school for
daintiness; she is wasting and pining for want
of proper nourishment and care and kindness.
They are killing her by inches," continued
Queenie, losing self-restraint and clasping her
hands together.  "When she cannot learn they
shut her up in a desolate garret at the top of the
house, where she gets frightened and has gloomy
fancies; they will not listen to me when I tell
them she is weak and ill.  She is getting so thin
that I can carry her, and yet they will not see
it."
</p>

<p>
"Humph! all this is very pleasant.  Young lady,
you are determined to have your say, and I have
let you say it; now you must listen to me.  You
are trying to plead the cause of Emily Calcott,
my niece, to interest me in her favor.  What if I
tell you," continued Mr. Calcott, raising his voice
a little till it sounded harder and more metallic&mdash;"what
if I tell you that I have no niece?"
</p>

<p>
"It would not be the truth, Mr. Calcott."
</p>

<p>
"What if I tell you that I have renounced the
relationship," reiterated the old man, frowning at
the interruption; "what if I once had a sister
Emily, but that from the time of her marriage
she became nothing to me!  She left me," he
went on, lashing himself into white passion by
the remembrance of his wrongs, "when she
knew I was a lonely, suffering man,&mdash;suffering
mentally, suffering physically,&mdash;aye, when she
knew too that she was the only thing spared to
me out of the wreck of my life, that I cared for
nothing in the world but her."
</p>

<p>
"Could you not forgive her for loving my
father?" interposed Queenie softly.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! she had no love for him.  She was
fooled by a soft tongue and handsome face; she
was to choose between us,&mdash;the invalid sorely-tried
brother, who had cared for her all her life,
and Frank Marriott,&mdash;and she chose him."
</p>

<p>
"She did, and became our dearest blessing."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, he valued his blessing," with a sneer;
"he did not drag her down, and wear out her
youth for her, eh?  What does it matter what he
did?  From that day she was no sister of mine;
I did not welcome her when she came to me, or
feel grieved when she left."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! we knew that too well when she came
back to us looking so sad and weary."
</p>

<p>
"She told Frank Marriott that I repulsed and
treated her cruelly, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she never told him that; she bore her
troubles silently, and brooded over them; but,"
in a low voice, "it helped to kill her."
</p>

<p>
The veins on Mr. Calcott's forehead swelled
visibly, and his eyes became bloodshot.
</p>

<p>
"What, girl! you come into my house uninvited
and accuse me of being my sister's murderer!
Do you know I can have you up for
libel and falsehood?"
</p>

<p>
"I never told a falsehood in my life," returned
Queenie simply; and somehow the young quiet
voice seemed to soothe the old man's fury.
"Poor mamma was unhappy, and grew weaker
and weaker; and so when the fever came she had
no strength to throw it off.  The doctors never
expected her to die, but I did always.  Once in
the middle of the night I heard her say, 'I ought
never to have left Andrew&mdash;poor Andrew;' but
I did not understand it then."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, she repented!  I knew she would.
Listen to me, girl, and then you will know
you have come to me on a fruitless errand.
Time after time she used to come crying to me,
and asking me to lend her husband money.  I
loathed the fellow, and she knew it; and one
day, when she had angered me terribly, I took a
dreadful oath, that neither Frank Marriott or any
child of hers should ever have a penny of my
money&mdash;and Caleb heard me."
</p>

<p>
"I knew all this, Mr. Calcott."
</p>

<p>
"You knew this, and yet you came to me.  Do
you expect me to perjure myself for the sake of
my precious niece?"
</p>

<p>
"I think such perjury would bring a blessing
on your head."
</p>

<p>
"You think so, eh?" regarding her with
astonishment and perplexity.  Strange to say,
her independent answers and fearless bearing did
not displease him; on the contrary, they seemed
to allay his wrath.  The white eyebrows twitched
involuntarily as he watched her from under them.
In spite of himself and his anger, he felt an
inexplicable yearning towards this girl, who sat there
in her shabby clothes and looked at him with
such clear, honest eyes.  Somehow the young
presence seemed to lighten the desolate room, so
long untrodden by any woman's foot.  "If she
were any one but Frank Marriott's daughter&mdash;"
but here the softer mood evaporated.  "Tut! what
should you know of such things?  There,
you have said your lesson, and said it well.  Go
home, girl; go home."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go back to your niece, sir, and say
to her that one of her own flesh and blood has
deserted her?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no niece, I tell you; I will not have
a hated relationship forced upon me."
</p>

<p>
"Your name is Andrew Calcott, and therefore
you are Emmie's uncle.  Take care, for heaven's
sake; you cannot get rid of your responsibility
in this way.  If Emmie dies her death will lie
at your door."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to ask a lady to withdraw, but I
will hear no more."
</p>

<p>
"One moment, and I will take your hint,"
returned Queenie, rising and turning very pale.
"You are merciless, Mr. Calcott, but you shall
not find me troublesome after this, though we
were perishing of hunger, though Emmie were
dying in my arms.  I will not crave your bounty.
You have received me coldly," she continued
with emotion, "you have given me hard,
sneering words, but I do not resent them; you are
refusing to help me in my bitter strait; you are
leaving me young and single-handed to fight
in this cruel, cruel world; you have disowned
your own niece, and are sending me back
to her almost broken-hearted, but I will not
reproach you; nay, if it would not make you
angry, I could almost say, I am sorry for you."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry for me!  Is the girl mad?" but again
the white eyebrows twitched uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for you," repeated Queenie, in her
clear young voice, "because you are old and
lonely; because you have only hard, miserable
thoughts to keep you company; because when you
are ill no one will comfort you, when you die no
one will shed tears over your grave.  It must be
so dreadful," continued the girl, "not to want
love, to be able to do without it.  Don't be angry,
Mr. Calcott, I am sorry for you; I am indeed."
</p>

<p>
Not only the eyelids, but the rigid lines of
the mouth twitched convulsively, but his only
answer was to point to the door; but, as though
irresistibly and painfully attracted by this
spectacle of loveless old age, Queenie still lingered.
</p>

<p>
"Emmie never forgets you, sir.  She does not
love you; how can she? but she still says the
prayer mamma taught her&mdash;'God bless poor
Uncle Andrew.'  Now I have seen you I shall
ask her never to forget it."
</p>

<p>
"Leave me," was all his answer; and this
time Queenie obeyed him.  Had she remained
she would have been frightened by the change
that came over him.  The veins of the forehead
were swollen and purple now, the twitching of
the mouth increased, a strange numbness seemed
creeping over him.  That night Mr. Calcott was
alarmingly ill.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
LOCKED IN.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The path my father's foot<br>
  Had trod me out (which suddenly broke off<br>
  And passed) alone I carried on, and set<br>
  My child-heart 'gainst the thorny underwood<br>
  To reach the grassy shelter of the trees.<br>
  Ah, babe i' the wood, without a brother babe!<br>
  My own self pity, like the red-breast bird,<br>
  Flies back to cover all that past with leaves."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aurora Leigh.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the door of the inhospitable mansion closed
behind Queenie she was conscious of a strange
feeling of revulsion and weakness, a blank,
hopeless depression of mind and body.  At the first
touch of the keen wintry air she shivered and
staggered slightly.
</p>

<p>
"All this has been too much for me; I wonder
if I am ill," she said to herself in a vague,
wondering way; and then she remembered that she had
eaten nothing since the early morning.  Suspense
and anxiety had deprived her of appetite, and she
had sent away her dinner untasted.  "Whatever
happens I must keep strong, for Emmie's sake,"
she thought, and she went into a baker's shop
and bought two buns; but as she broke one she
remembered that Emmie's sickly appetite had
turned that day from the untempting viands
placed before her.
</p>

<p>
"Emmy will eat these, she is so fond of buns,"
she thought, and she asked for a glass of water,
which the woman gave civilly enough, telling her
that she looked faint, and ought to rest for a little
while; but Queenie thanked her and shook her
head.
</p>

<p>
For a little while she walked on aimlessly;
she felt stunned and broken, and felt that she
dared not face Emmie until she had recovered
herself.  She was too weak to walk far, but where
could she go? she could not face Caleb's eager
questioning, she thought, and yet his house was
her only haven.  Service at the cathedral had
long been over, the minor canon and some of the
choir boys had brushed past her in the High-street,
laughing and talking merrily; if she could
only go and sit there for a little, until she felt
stronger.  Then she remembered, in a dazed sort
of way, that she had heard that the workmen
were doing some repairs in the nave, and were
working late; it might be worth her while to
find out if they had left one of the doors open.
She felt a momentary sensation of pleasure at
discovering this was the case.  One or two of the
men were still there, and the organist was
practising some Christmas anthems.  Queenie crept
into one of the canon's carved stalls and listened.
A light gleamed from the organ, but the altar
and choir were in deep shadow.  The men were
laughing over their work; a beautiful tenor voice
broke out with Gounod's 'Bethlehem,' the organ
pealed and reverberated through the dim aisles.
</p>

<p>
Christmastime, "peace and good will on earth
the angels' song," sounding through all time.
Alas! what peace in the sore, rancorous heart of
the old man she had just left!  Ought she not to
feel pity for one whom the good angel of mercy
had forsaken?
</p>

<p>
"The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel."
Where had she heard those words?  In church
of course.  Was Mr. Calcott wicked, or was he
simply a soured, vindictive man, who considered
himself ill-used by the world?
</p>

<p>
Her step-mother had loved him and had left
him, and then had yearned after him with a
bitterness of yearning that had shortened her life.
Why had she accused herself, on her death-bed,
of selfishness in leaving him?  She had hinted
indeed more than once of some great trouble that
had warped his nature in early manhood; and
yet what brother had a right to demand the
sacrifice of a sister's whole life?  Her step-mother
had no morbid views of duty, but she had chidden
herself for so leaving him.
</p>

<p>
There must be some mystery of which even
Caleb was ignorant.  Caleb and his fellow-clerks
spoke shudderingly of the fits of ungovernable
rage to which Mr. Calcott was subject at times;
and Queenie knew that for many years he had
led the life of a recluse.  People spoke of him as
an eccentric person, a misanthrope, in fact; but he
was not generally disliked, though his clerks and
servants feared him.  He gave largely in charities,
and was always first in the subscription list in
the town, and spoke much at vestries.  The firm
of Calcott and Calcott had always been respected
in Carlisle, but of late he had withdrawn almost
wholly from public life, and people said his
health was failing.  Queenie pondered over this
problem till her head ached, and the organ
changed melody and broke out into a sweet
minor key; then a magnificent solemn prelude,
sounding the keynote of every possible pain, an
infinite march of woe tracing the footsteps of a
Divine majestic life, and wrapping wonderful
meanings and solemn hints in every chord&mdash;and
Queenie knew she was listening to Handel's
unrivalled overture to the 'Messiah.'
</p>

<p>
The sadder music pleased her better and made
the tears flow, a luxury not often indulged by
the overtasked governess.  After all, would she
change places with the miserable man she had
left?  Her trials were great no doubt, but she had
youth and health and energy, and Emmie and
Cathy loved her.  By-and-by, when this dreadful
winter was over and spring came, they would
go down to Cathy's home, and Emmie would be
a happy child for some weeks at least; they must
live in hopes of that.  After all there must be a
meaning in the pain they had to bear; and then
Queenie thought of a strange picture she had
seen as a child, painted by a poor crazy artist
living in their neighbourhood, at least her father
had said he was crazy, though she and her
step-mother had thought otherwise.  It was
called "The March of Suffering," and it was
explained to Queenie that it was an allegorical
picture of life.  Her father had pished and
pooh-poohed it as a dismal caricature, but her
step-mother had shed tears over it, she remembered;
one of the figures had attracted them both&mdash;a
young girl with a sweet, resolute face, carrying a
spiked cross in her bleeding hand, an old man
before her had fallen down, and lay with his grey
hair grovelling in the dust, and, still holding the
torturing cross firmly with one hand, she had
stooped to raise him.
</p>

<p>
The face and figure lingered in Queenie's
childish memory, and recurred to her mind as
the solemn notes of the 'Messiah' reverberated
through the cathedral.  "My cross has spikes
too," she thought; and then the workmen went
out noisily shouldering their tools, and the young
man with the tenor voice came clanking through
the choir, and stared at poor pale Queenie as
though she were a ghost, and the organ died
away with a long plaintive wail.
</p>

<p>
Queenie followed them reluctantly; the buns
were still in her pocket, but she had forgotten
her faintness.  As she stepped out into the dark
narrow close she could see the windows of the
Dean's house brightly illuminated, a few stars
shone in the December sky.  a cutting wind lurked
round every corner, a faint vaporous moon
shone over the cathedral.
</p>

<p>
It was too cold to linger; even the dark,
cheerless school-room, with its cindery fire and
insufficient light, would be better than the streets
of Carlisle on such a night.  Emmie would be
wondering, too, what had become of her, and be
picturing her all this time seated in Caleb's
easy parlor: at this thought she drew her
thin cloak closer round her and hurried on.
</p>

<p>
When she reached Granite Lodge she rang for
some time without gaining admittance; this
surprised her.
</p>

<p>
"It is very cold standing out here so long,
Mary," she said quietly, as the girl opened the
door at last, and looked at her with a scared
face.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you have come, Miss," she
returned; "Miss Clayton is in such a way, and all
the young ladies.  Fraulein has been going on
awful, and mistress and Miss Tozer are out."
</p>

<p>
"Emmie!" was Queenie's only thought as she
hurried on to the school-room, but a flying footstep
on the stairs arrested her, and Cathy rushed
down to her looking pale and terrified.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queenie, where have you been?  I
expected you home hours ago; Fraulein has been
going on in the most scandalous way, and Miss
Titheridge is out, and I am so frightened about
Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Where is she? what do you mean?" asked
poor Queenie, her knees suddenly knocking
together with weakness, and her lips becoming dry
all at once.
</p>

<p>
"Emmie had not been doing anything, only
she was stupid and could not learn her lessons,
you know her way, and Fraulein got into an
awful rage, worse than I have ever seen her, and
boxed Emmie's ears, so that the poor child was
quite giddy; and when I spoke up and called her
a cruel thing she sent Emmie up to her room, and
locked her in, and put the key in her pocket; and
though I have been going on at her like mad
she will not give it up."
</p>

<p>
"Locked her up in the dark!" almost screamed
Queenie.  Her own voice sounded quite awful to
her; she was half way up the stairs by this time,
with Cathy panting behind her.
</p>

<p>
"What could we do, Queenie? don't look like
that.  I have been sitting on the floor outside
the door for hours, till I was almost starved with
cold, talking to her."
</p>

<p>
"She talked then!" pausing a moment on the
garret stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she cried a good deal, and I talked, but
she has not answered lately," stammered Cathy;
"perhaps she is asleep, she complained of feeling
giddy and confused;" but Cathy, whose eyes
were red with crying, did not add how
passionately the child had beaten against the door and
implored to be let out.  "She was so afraid of
the darkness, and she wanted to hold some one's
hand."  Neither did she add that just before
Queenie's ring she had been frightened by a
stifled groan, and then a sound as though
something heavy had fallen; but her hesitation and
evident terror were enough for Queenie, and in
another moment she was kneeling outside the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Emmie dear!  Emmie, my darling! it is
I&mdash;Queenie; there is nothing to fear&mdash;nothing;
speak to me just one word, darling, to say you
are not so very frightened, and then I will go
down and get the key from Fraulein.  Emmie,
Emmie! do you hear?" shaking the door; but
there was no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Stay there, Cathy," whispered Queenie in a
hoarse voice; "I am going to Fraulein."  Her
face was white with apprehension, but the look
in her eyes scared Cathy.
</p>

<p>
The girls were huddled together and whispering
in knots of twos and threes as she entered the
school-room.  There was evidently a mutiny, for
Fraulein, with heated face and harsh voice, was
vainly calling to order.  A murmur of "shame! we
will tell Miss Titheridge," came to Queenie's
ears, but she heeded nothing as she walked up to
the table with out-stretched hand.
</p>

<p>
"Give me that key, Fraulein!"
</p>

<p>
The woman looked at her with an expression
at once stolid and immovable; the heavy
Teutonic face was unusually lowering.  Queenie had
more than once suspected that Fraulein was
addicted to a somewhat free use of stimulant;
now as she looked at the inflamed, stupid face
she was sure of it.
</p>

<p>
"Meess shall not dictate to me, I am mistress
of this school-room to-night; the leetle Meess
was naughty, unbearable; she must be punished."
</p>

<p>
"Give me that key at once, or I will break
open the door; give me that key, or you will
rue it all your life," continued Queenie, sternly.
The woman quailed for a moment under that
bright indignant glance, and then she looked up
with an expression of triumphant cunning.
</p>

<p>
"Do not fatigue yourself, Meess, the key is
safe in my pocket; there it will remain until my
dear friend, Meess Titheridge, returns; ach nein
Meess shall not have it."
</p>

<p>
For a single instant Queenie measured the
strong, powerful frame of the woman before her,
then she turned from her without a word.  "Clarice
Williams, Agatha Sinclair, stand by me and
be witnesses that I am forced by sheer necessity
to do this thing;" and with that she quitted the
room.
</p>

<p>
Many of the girls would have followed, but
Fraulein ordered them to their seats so savagely
that they dared not rebel.  As she went up the
stairs the door-bell again sounded.  Cathy rose
with a look of relief on seeing her friend.  "Have
you got the key, Queenie?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Queenie, doggedly.  "Stand
back, Cathy; I am going to break open the door."
</p>

<p>
Either the young muscles were braced with
new strength, or else the fastening of the door
was crazy with age, but as Queenie threw herself
against it with all her force the wood-work
round the lock splintered, and in another moment
the door yielded.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Cathy, the light!  Ah, merciful
heavens! the savages!" as she threw herself
down on the floor beside the white, senseless
figure of the child and gathered it into her arms.
</p>

<p>
"She is not dead&mdash;she has only fainted,
Queenie!  Oh, Queenie, don't look like that!"
cried poor Cathy, sobbing as though her heart
would break over the pitiful spectacle.  The
elder sister's face was as white as the child's, her
eyes were burning and dilated.
</p>

<p>
"If she is dead, Fraulein is her murderer.  Out
of the way, Cathy.  They have gone too far; they
shall hear me now; don't stop me&mdash;nothing on
earth shall stop me from speaking!"
</p>

<p>
"Queenie, Queenie, come back; are you mad?"
but Cathy might as well have spoken to the
wind; she could do nothing but follow, protesting
at every step.  As they crossed the hall they
could hear Miss Titheridge's voice raised
somewhat sharply in the school-room; she had
returned, then.  Queenie made no comment;
she simply walked in and laid her unconscious
burthen at the governess's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott, good heavens! what does this
mean?" and Miss Titheridge recoiled in absolute
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"It means that Emmie is dead, and that
Fraulein is her murderer!" returned Queenie in
an awful voice.  The poor thing really believed
it for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," sobbed Cathy, sitting down on the
floor and drawing the heavy head on to her lap;
"she is not dead, she is living, breathing; some
of you help me to revive her; it is cold and
fright and hunger that has made her faint.  Oh,
Miss Titheridge, don't mind poor Queenie, she is
almost beside herself."
</p>

<p>
"If she is not dead she is dying," persisted
the girl in a hoarse voice.  "No, don't touch her;
don't dare to touch her!" as Miss Titheridge,
with a sudden feeling of remorse, bent over the
unconscious child and lifted the little cold hand.
"It is in your house this deed is done; ask
Fraulein, who has shut her up in the dark for
hours, pinching with cold and hunger, and in
spite of all her cries to be released; ask Cathy;
ask Clarice; ask any of them."
</p>

<p>
"Fraulein, is this true?" and Miss Titheridge
looked absolutely shocked.  She had treated the
poor orphan with hardness and severity, but she
was not a bad woman.  A sudden revulsion of
feeling came over her as she looked at the
prostrate figure in Cathy's lap; "Fraulein, is it
true that you could have acted so barbarously?"
</p>

<p>
"It is true; and it is not the first time,"
returned Queenie.  "If she dies, Miss Titheridge,
her death will lie at your door as well as
Fraulein's; if she die, look to yourselves, for I will
have justice, if there is justice in England.  All
Carlisle shall know how you have treated the
child committed to your care.  As to that
woman," pointing with her finger to Fraulein,
who now looked on in stupid terror at this scene,
"she will live to rue this day if Emmie dies."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush, my dear Miss Marriott; be
calm and reasonable, I entreat you."  Miss
Titheridge had turned very pale, she was quite
cowed by the girl's fierce despair.  There was a
wild, strange light in Queenie's eyes as she faced
them, as she hurled words of righteous wrath at
the shrinking women.  "My dear Miss Marriott,
I am more grieved than I can say.  I will do
what you like.  Send for a doctor; do what you
please; only be calm."
</p>

<p>
"Calm!" repeated Queenie, in a voice of such
utter heartbreak that tears positively came to
Miss Titheridge's hard eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; send for a doctor; do something all of
you," implored Cathy; but as one or two of the
girls stepped up timidly with proffers of
assistance Queenie waved them fiercely away.
</p>

<p>
"No; you none of you loved her; you shall
not touch her.  Give her to me.  Come with me,
Cathy;" and as Cathy obeyed her wondering,
Queenie led the way to Cathy's room, and laid
her on Cathy's bed.
</p>

<p>
"Shut them all out; I will have no one but
you," she had said to her friend.  When the
doctor arrived he found the two girls trying
vainly to restore animation to the child.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head very gravely when Cathy
told him all, for Queenie never spoke again
during that dreadful night.  "This is a sad case,"
he said at last, after a careful examination.
"When she wakes up I fear she will not know
you; brain fever is the least we can expect from
such a shock.  Acute terror on an exhausted
system often leads to very sad results, especially
with nervous children."  But though he spoke in
a low tone, Queenie heard him.

<br><br>
DARK DAYS.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Emmie did not die, neither were her physician's
worst fears verified; but for many a long week
the frail existence hovered between life and
death.
</p>

<p>
When the lethargy had passed a long season
of delirium intervened, and every symptom of
severe brain fever manifested itself.  For weeks
the little sufferer failed to recognize the loving
faces that bent over her.  Caleb Runciman spent
most of his leisure hours beside the bedside,
holding the hand of his little favorite, and
gazing sorrowfully at the thin flushed face
tossing so restlessly on the pillow.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Molly, with her pleasant features
and brisk homely ways, would come and watch
through the long night, that Queenie might
enjoy a few hours' repose.  Caleb and his faithful
Molly were the only visitors to the sick room.
Miss Titheridge had pleaded once, almost with
tears, to be allowed to take some part in the
nursing, but Queenie had sternly refused.
"Emmie shall see no one but those who love her,"
was the invariable reply.
</p>

<p>
Granite Lodge was deserted now; Cathy and
the other girls had long ago gone home for the
Christmas holidays.  Cathy clung to her friends,
crying bitterly, when the moment arrived for
saying good-bye; but Queenie only looked at her
with great weary eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go home and tell Garth and Langley
everything.  They will be sure to ask you to come
to us, after my London visit in May, to stay
with us for a long, long time."
</p>

<p>
"If Emmie be ever strong enough," began
Queenie; but somehow she could not finish her
sentence.  She suffered all Cathy's caresses
passively, and then went back to her old place and
laid her head on Emmie's pillow.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as though nothing could rouse her
from the strange apathy that had crept over her
after that terrible night.  She heard almost
without emotion that Fraulein had been dismissed;
only, as the luggage was brought downstairs,
and she heard Miss Titheridge's voice speaking
in a subdued key in the corridor outside, she
quietly left her place and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
Fraulein Heimer was at the head of the staircase
in her travelling dress; she seemed petrified
at the sight of Queenie.  The girl walked up to
her and laid her hand on her wrist.  "Come
here, Fraulein, I want you a moment," she said
quietly; and, strange to say, the woman obeyed
her without a word, and followed her to the
threshold of the sick-room; but Queenie would
not suffer her to enter.  "You can see your work
from here," she continued, in a suppressed voice.
"Ah! she is smiling at you; she does not know
you tried to be her murderer."
</p>

<p>
"You are cruel; you will have your revenge,
or you would not have brought me here, Meess."  The
woman's coarse, brutal nature was absolutely
cowed by the spectacle of suffering innocence.
</p>

<p>
The child lay upon her pillow smiling icily, and
waving her emaciated arms to and fro upon the
coverlid; the fair hair was closely shaven, the
eyes dilated and brilliant.
</p>

<p>
"I have always longed for a cowslip ball; ask
that lady to make me one, mamma; and strings
and strings of daisy chains."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you bring me here, Meess?  I will
not stay, I will not look!  Ach das arme
Engelein; ach guädidge Himmel."  The woman was
trembling and all but hysterical.  Queenie's
detaining hand dropped from her wrist; her
revenge was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you to know how we suffered.  Sometime,
if Emmie gets well, I shall try to bring
myself to forgive you; but not till then.  There
go, she is calling to me; she always calls me
mamma."
</p>

<p>
It would not be too much to say that that
sick room became Queenie's world; she knew
literally nothing of what passed outside it.
Cathy wrote long letters to her, but she seldom
answered them.  One day she enclosed a note
from Langley.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Marriott," it began, "Cathy's
glowing description of her friend makes us long
to know you; and my brother and I trust, that
you and your dear little sister will be able to
pay us a visit in the early summer.  We know
all your troubles, and wish that it were in our
power to lighten them&mdash;" but here a restless
movement from Emmie disturbed her, and she
laid the letter aside.
</p>

<p>
Emmie's wanderings were rarely painful to the
listener.  A merciful oblivion had stamped out
the memory of that terrible night; generally
her talk was of the country.  She imagined
herself wandering in beautiful places with her
mother and Queenie; gathering flowers, or else
picking up shells and sea-weed on the shore.
Now and then there would be a troubled break&mdash;the
waves were threatening to engulph her&mdash;or a
serpent, or strange-headed beast lurked among
the flowers; at such times she would grow
restless, and it required all Queenie's efforts
to tranquillize her, while the constant cry of
"Mamma, mamma," was pitiful to hear from the
lips of the motherless child.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma is here," Queenie would answer with
loving falsehood, laying the burning face on her
breast; and something of the intense mother-love,
seemed really to pass into the girl's heart.
</p>

<p>
She was growing haggard and hollow-eyed
under the strain of the long nursing.  The doctor
shook his head and remonstrated in vain, and
Caleb's entreaties were equally unavailing.  "You
will be ill, Miss Queenie; every one says so.
You are up every night unless Molly is here, and
barely snatch an hour's sleep in the twenty-four;
you are over-taxing your strength, and a breakdown
will be the consequence."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not break down as long as Emmie
wants me," returned the girl bravely, but her lip
trembled as though with weakness; she was
becoming conscious that all this was becoming a
terrible effort, that her strength would not hold
out for ever.  A sudden noise jarred upon her
now; and once or twice, when her kind old friend
was speaking to her, she had great trouble to
refrain from bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes of an evening, when Caleb was
there, she would wrap herself in a shawl, and
walk up and down the stone hall and corridors
to allay her restlessness; sometimes the door
would open, and a red gleam shine out from Miss
Titheridge's snug parlor, where she sat in cosy
fireside circle with her friends.  She looked up
oddly and half-scared as Queenie's white face
glimmered out of the darkness, but she never
invited her to enter; the girl had repulsed her
too surely for that.
</p>

<p>
The upstair corridor had a window at each
end.  Queenie was never weary of pacing this.
Sometimes the moonlight flooded it, and she
trod in a perfect pathway of light; once or
twice she stood looking out on the snowy
house-tops, shining under the eerie light of
stars.
</p>

<p>
It seemed months since she had sat in the
curious carved stall in the cathedral, since she
had heard the Christmas anthems and Gounod's
'Bethlehem'; months since she had stood beside
the old man's chair, pleading for his own flesh
and blood.
</p>

<p>
Caleb had spoken to her once or twice of
Mr. Calcott's strange and alarming seizure.  He had
kept his room ever since, and was considered in
a somewhat critical state, he believed.  Queenie
heard him vaguely; but no suspicion as to the
cause of his illness entered her mind.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that really roused her was
when Emmie first feebly called her by her name.
It was the night before the girls came back to
school.  Caleb had not yet paid his evening
visit, and the sisters were alone.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Queenie?" Emmie had said.  "I
thought it was mamma," and Queenie had fallen
on her knees, and murmured her thanksgiving
with floods of grateful tears.
</p>

<p>
"I know Caleb too," she had said later on,
when the old man came to her bedside; and
something of the old quaint smile flitted over
her face at the sight of her favorite.  "Have I
been ill, Caleb?  Queenie has been crying
dreadfully, and yet she says she is very happy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my precious lamb, you have been ill;
and Miss Queenie there has almost knocked
herself up with nursing you; but now you are going
to get well and strong," laying down the little
skeleton hand that could not raise itself.  "Hush,
my pretty; hush, Miss Emmie, my dear," as a
large tear stole down the thin face; "you must
not fret now you are getting better."
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry for my Queen, my poor
tired Queen," sobbed the child; but she was
soon hushed and comforted by assurances that
Queenie was only a little tired and would soon
get rested.
</p>

<p>
Emmie slept for hours after this; and before
many days were over a faint but steady progress
was perceptible.  Cathy indeed was shocked at
her appearance, and wondered if anything so
thin and unsubstantial could really be Emmie.
Emmie smiled at her, but was too weak to speak
more than a word or two.
</p>

<p>
One day, when she was well enough to be
raised into a sitting posture and propped up
with pillows, Caleb entered with a mysterious-looking
basket, from whence proceeded a faint
scratching sound; and this being opened, a small
long-haired kitten, with a tiny perky face and
bushy tail, crept mewing into Emmie's arms.
</p>

<p>
The child's delight and astonishment at the
sight of the long-coveted treasure were almost
overpowering, and she hugged the creature to
her without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Is it mine? is it really mine? will they let
me keep it?" she gasped at length.
</p>

<p>
"It is my belief that they would let you keep
a whole menagerie, if Miss Queenie there chose
to say she wished it," returned Caleb with a
sly glance at her; "some folks are properly
frightened."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Miss Titheridge will let you keep it,"
replied her sister quietly; "you need not be
afraid; she is very kind now, Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I know; when you are down at your
lessons she often comes and sits with me; she
brought me that funny little man full of
sweetmeats yesterday.  I went to give some of them
to Cathy."
</p>

<p>
Queenie knew of these surreptitious visits, but
she took no notice; it needed time to erase the
memory of those years of neglect and cruelty.
Emmie's sweet nature knew no resentment; but
with Queenie it was different.
</p>

<p>
She saw that Miss Titheridge was afraid of
her.  "She has reason," thought Queenie; "she
has injured me deeply.  If the time ever comes
to get rid of us both, she will do so gladly; but
I do not mean to give her the chance; I am
determined to find work elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
As soon as Emmie could safely be left for an
hour or two Queenie resumed her work in the
school-room unasked; now and then she stole
upstairs for a peep at the invalid.  She sometimes
found Emmie asleep with the kitten in her arms,
or surrounded by the pictures and flowers which
the girls lavished on her.  She would look up,
and say cheerily as Queenie entered, "I am not a
bit dull; Cathy and Clarice have been up, and
just now Miss Titheridge brought me some jelly,
and kittie and I have had such games," and then
Queenie would go down again with a lightened
heart to her uncongenial task.
</p>

<p>
She often worked late into the night, that she
might devote more time to Emmie.  The child
flagged and grew weary towards evening, and
then Queenie never left her.  Long after all the
inmates of Granite Lodge had fallen into a
refreshing sleep the young governess would
trim the shaded lamp, and pore patiently over
the pile of copy-books waiting for correction.
Even when her head was on the pillow she could
not always rest.  The future lay dark before her;
she must find other work; but where? that was
the question.
</p>

<p>
Emmie was gaining strength day by day; but
for months, perhaps years, she would require the
greatest care.  The doctor's orders were stringent.
She must not open a book for months; the brain
would not bear the slightest pressure; she must
lead a child's unthinking life&mdash;eat, drink, and
play, and, above all, sleep.
</p>

<p>
Emmie took very kindly to this <i>régime</i>.  She
spent most of her time in sleep; during the
remainder of her waking hours she would lie in
languid content watching the antics of her
kitten, or waiting for Queenie to come and talk
to her.
</p>

<p>
Queenie made up her mind at last that she
must speak to Miss Titheridge; and one evening
she entered the little room where the governess
sat casting up her accounts for the last month.
</p>

<p>
She looked up a little amazed at the interruption;
but her manner changed when she saw
Queenie, and became as usual slightly embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me, Miss Marriott? is there
anything wrong with Emmie?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, thank you.  I only wanted to speak
to you about myself.  I think it right that we
should come to some sort of understanding about
the future."
</p>

<p>
"About the future?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Titheridge,"&mdash;Queenie was the more
self-possessed of the two,&mdash;"it seems to me that
we cannot go on like this much longer.  Emmie's
illness has been a great expense and trouble; and,
as far as I see, she will not cease to be a trouble
for a long time to come, and we have no right to
burthen you."
</p>

<p>
"It is certainly very unfortunate," began the
governess.  "Dr. Prout is very kind about it;
but still, as you say, it is a sad inconvenience;
one of my best rooms too."
</p>

<p>
"As long as Emmie remains she cannot go
back to her old one.  Dr. Prout expressly forbids
it; he says any renewal of the terror might be
fatal."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must say no more about it then,"
turning over her papers nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  Believe me," continued Queenie
earnestly, "I do thank you for your kindness,
tardy though it be to Emmie.  I am only sorry
that I cannot feel more grateful for it; but after
what has happened there can be no question of
gratitude between us."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry you are of so unforgiving a
disposition, Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"I hope it is not that.  I think it is that I have
suffered too much to be able to forget; but what
I meant to say was this: Emmie's weak health
is only likely to be an inconvenience, and we
have no right to burthen a stranger.  I have
therefore reluctantly acceded to my old friend
Mr. Runciman's request, to place Emmie with
him, while I look out for fresh work.  He has
found me hard to persuade," continued the girl,
smiling faintly as Caleb's arguments recurred to
her; "but circumstances have somewhat changed,
and I do not fear now that this step will injure
him."
</p>

<p>
"And when do you intend to leave me?"
enquired Miss Titheridge in an injured voice, for
Queenie was too valuable a governess to replace
easily.  In her heart, though, she was secretly
relieved at the course things were taking; now
she would not have the onus of dismissing the
orphans from her roof.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be glad to remain until Easter,"
replied Queenie, quietly; and as Miss Titheridge
only bowed her head and made no comment she
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"I have done the deed, Cathy," she said,
coming into her friend's room, looking pale and
exhausted; "and now it is off my mind.  After
Easter we shall be homeless."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" interrupted Cathy, rapturously
embracing her; "you will only be out of the
dragon's clutches.  You are coming to us for
a long, long visit; and you shall not leave us
until you have found another situation; and
after that Emmie is going to that dear funny
Mr. Runciman's."
</p>

<p>
"Only for a little while; I shall not leave
her long there.  You see Mr. Calcott's illness has
made a difference; they say he will never be well,
and so he will not find out that Caleb is going to
have Emmie; besides which, Caleb has promised
to take the money I gave Miss Titheridge."
</p>

<p>
"So your pride is satisfied.  I am glad of that,
my dear Madam Dignity.  Now let us go and sit
with Emmie."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
AN ERRAND OF MERCY.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "Speak gently to the aged one;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieve not the careworn heart:<br>
  The sands of life are nearly run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let such in peace depart."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Christian Lyrics.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Caleb Runciman had told Queenie that Mr. Calcott
was seriously ill; but the girl had received
the news with indifference, making no comments.
"What was his life&mdash;his useless, loveless life&mdash;in
comparison with Emmie's?" she thought with
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Presently, when her trouble had lightened a
little, and Emmie was slowly advancing towards
convalescence, she remembered her hardness with
some compunction; and her heart grew soft and
pitiful over the thought of that lonely sick-room.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if Mr. Calcott remembers my
visit?" she said once to Caleb, but Caleb only
shook his head in silence.  He had not as yet
been admitted to his employer's presence.  The
illness was enveloped in mystery, and all sorts of
reports were current with respect to it.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them guessed the truth, or knew
the strange thoughts and memories that haunted
the sick man's pillow.  The past was ever before
him; conscience, so long dormant, had roused at
last, and had laid hold of him with fierce and
angry grip; he saw himself the victim of a
hypochondria so fell and senseless that it had warped
and scathed his better nature.
</p>

<p>
His past life was mapped out before him: a
youth of disease and suffering, soothed only by a
sister's love; a querulous, discontented manhood,
darkened by fits of strange melancholy; then
years of loneliness and brooding.
</p>

<p>
Why had he failed with his life?  Other men
had suffered as well as he; other men had
experienced the same passionate sorrows, had reaped
disappointment where they had expected happiness,
had battled with chronic disease, and yet
had borne themselves bravely before the world!
Why had he grown so hardened and exasperated
against his kind that his very servants trembled
in his presence?
</p>

<p>
What words were those that rung in his ear
till the very air seemed to vibrate with them:
"I am sorry for you, because you are old
and lonely; because you have only miserable
thoughts to keep you company; because when
you are ill no one will comfort you, when you
die no one will shed tears over your grave."
</p>

<p>
Curses on that girl!  How dared she stand and
pity him to his face! him&mdash;Andrew Calcott&mdash;whom
every one feared and respected&mdash;the man
so outwardly prosperous that the world never
guessed at the strange fiend that gnawed at his
vitals!
</p>

<p>
"It must be so dreadful not to want love, to
be able to do without it;" and again, "Emmie
never forgets you, sir.  She does not love you;
how can she? but she still says the prayer
mamma taught her&mdash;'God bless poor Uncle
Andrew.'"  Ah! merciful heavens, would those
words never leave him?
</p>

<p>
By-and-bye the torment he suffered became
unbearable; whole sentences of that conversation
seemed stamped and burned upon the brain.  He
would say them aloud sometimes, to the terror of
those who watched him, and thought his mind
was wandering.
</p>

<p>
"You are refusing to help me in my bitter
strait; you are leaving me, young and
single-handed, to fight in this cruel, cruel world; you
have disowned your own niece, and are sending
me back to her almost broken-hearted; but I
will not reproach you;" and then she had come
closer to his chair, and had stood beside him,
almost touching him with her hand.
</p>

<p>
He could see her clearly; the whole scene
seemed photographed in his memory.  Was he
dreaming, or was she there really beside his bed?
</p>

<p>
He could recall every expression of her
countenance, every trick of her speech.  What a
young creature she had looked in her shabby
dress, sitting there before him.  How eloquently
she had spoken, and with what self-possession
and dignity.  Once or twice her voice had faltered,
and the tears had gathered in her large brown
eyes, as she pleaded for Emmie, but she had
brushed them away hastily, and had gone on
speaking.
</p>

<p>
If he had ever had a daughter he would have
liked her to have looked at him with those clear
honest glances.  The girl was absolutely without
guile.  Hard as he was, his heart had yearned over
her, and yet he had driven her from his presence.
Now and then a strange fancy, almost a longing,
seized him, to hear her speak again, if it were
only to tell him that she was sorry for him.  He
called himself a fool, and chid himself for his
weakness; but, nevertheless, the longing was
there and he knew it.
</p>

<p>
One evening, as Queenie was correcting some
themes in the class-room, she was told
Mr. Runciman wished to speak to her.
</p>

<p>
Caleb's visits were rare now, but he sometimes
came to bring a few snowdrops or violets to his
favorite.  To-night he was later than usual, and
Emmie was asleep.
</p>

<p>
"I am not come to see Emmie to-night; it is
you I want, Miss Queenie.  You might have
knocked me down with a feather when he gave
me the message.  But I suppose he is in his
right mind?" continued Caleb, his blue eyes
becoming very round and wide, and his rosy face
a trifle paler than usual.
</p>

<p>
"A message from whom?" enquired Queenie,
with some degree of curiosity.  She was pleased
to see her old friend; any break in the monotony
of her day was welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, you'll never guess.  Why, my dear
young lady, when he told me to come and fetch
you I was that flabbergasted&mdash;if you know the
meaning of such an outlandish word&mdash;that I
could not tell whether I was standing on my
head or my heels.  'I want you to fetch me
Frank Marriott's daughter,' he says, in a queer
off-hand way, and he shut his eyes and laid quite
quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean Mr. Calcott has sent for me?"
gasped Queenie for the moment.  She looked
quite frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sure enough, though I never thought
you would have guessed it so soon," returned
Caleb admiringly; "but women's wits beat men's
hollow.  Well, I couldn't believe my ears, and
no wonder; so I waited for him to open his eyes,
and then I ventured to ask him to be so good
as to repeat his speech, fearing I hadn't rightly
understood him."
</p>

<p>
"'You have understood me very well, Runciman,'
he said in a quiet meaning sort of way,
not quite pleased at my hesitation, you may be
sure.  It is 'do this, or go there, and be sharp
about it,' with Mr. Calcott, always.  'Please lose
no time over your errand, but bring Frank
Marriott's daughter back with you; I want to
see if  can get to sleep to-night.'  That's all, on
my word and honor, Miss Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"It is very strange, but I suppose I must go;
perhaps he has repented his unkindness, and
wants to tell me so.  Wait a minute, Caleb, while
I tell Miss Titheridge.  Emmie is asleep, and so
I shall not mind leaving for half-an-hour."
</p>

<p>
"It is a wet night, I warn you; it is all of a
piece with his usual selfishness sending for you
on a night like this," fretted Caleb, who was
much perplexed and exercised in his mind by
the whole proceeding; but Queenie met this
additional trial with her usual cheerfulness,
and struggled along bravely under her old
umbrella.
</p>

<p>
This time they were not kept waiting.  Gurnel
eyed them quite as morosely, but he ushered
Caleb at once into a comfortable-looking dining-room
with a blazing fire, and wine and biscuits
on the table; while he begged Queenie civilly to
follow him, which she did, naïvely admiring the
carved balustrades and soft rich carpets as she
did so.
</p>

<p>
"My master is up, but he cannot leave his
room," explained the servant, as he ushered
Queenie into a large handsomely-furnished
bedroom, where Mr. Calcott lay on a couch beside
the fire, in his Indian dressing-gown, with an
eider-down quilt over him.  A respectable looking
woman sat with needle-work at a little round
table beside him.  At Queenie's entrance she
curtsied and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Queenie quietly took her place.
</p>

<p>
"You have sent for me," she said softly.  "I
am sorry to hear you have been so ill.  It is a
wet night, but I could not help coming," she
continued, trying to speak naturally, but she
could not; the change in the sick man appalled
her.  She understood, as she looked at him, that
he was slowly but surely dying.
</p>

<p>
"They tell me I have some months still before
me; that's bad hearing for those who wait upon
me, as I am likely to trouble them for some
time," with a touch of his old grimness.  "Well,
girl, so you have come through the wet and dark,
just to gratify a sick man's whim?"
</p>

<p>
"I would do more than that to oblige you,
sir," returned Queenie, with genuine compassion
in her voice.  The wan suffering face, the wasted
hand, stirred a world of pity in her soul.  Lonely,
unloved, and dying&mdash;resentment faded out of
her memory at a spectacle so pathetic, so truly
pitiful.
</p>

<p>
"What! do more than be sorry for me?"
with sardonic humor in his voice.  "You would
give more than a drop of water to poor Dives in
torment?  Do you remember, girl, that you dared
to pity me before?"
</p>

<p>
"My pity will not harm you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are so very ill, it may even do you
good to remember that we feel no bitterness
towards you, that we forgive all the wrong done
to us.  Why do you look towards that door? do
you want anything?"
</p>

<p>
"That woman has forgotten my medicine," he
muttered, "and I have the strange sinking again.
Hirelings are not worth the price of the bread
they eat."
</p>

<p>
"Let me give it you," returned Queenie,
rising, and mixing the draught; but he shook his
head.  "You must call her; I cannot raise myself,
and the least movement gives me pain."
</p>

<p>
"She has gone downstairs; let me try what I
can do.  You must not wait, indeed, Mr. Calcott;
your lips are turning blue and livid.  I am used
to nursing; I could lift mamma, and I have
carried Emmie about so much lately."  As she
spoke Queenie skilfully raised the invalid and
put the glass to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"If thine enemy hunger, feed him; and if he
thirst, give him drink."  Why did these words
come into the sick man's mind as he felt the
support of the strong young arm, and drank the
reviving draught from her hand?
</p>

<p>
"There, you are better now," went on Queenie
cheerfully, putting the pillow comfortably under
his head.  Mr. Calcott looked at her strangely,
and then he was silent for a long time.
</p>

<p>
"You are poor," he began at last.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we are very poor; you remember I told
you so."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, true!  I forgot all that.  You are used
to nursing too.  Mrs. Morton is a very capable
person, but I should like some one who would
read to me and amuse me.  I&mdash;" hesitating
slightly&mdash;"I would pay you handsomely if you
would come to me."
</p>

<p>
Queenie turned pale, and her eyes filled with
tears.  "Come to you at once?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure.  Do you think a dying man can
talk about the future?  I would make it worth
your while," he continued, as though anticipating
some objection.  "You shall ask your own sum;
I will buy your services at your own price."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! please don't talk so, you are only
paining me; it is impossible.  What? now! come
at once!  I could not leave Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"What folly!" he interrupted harshly.
"Have you not told me that you are fighting
single-handed against the world; that Emmie, as
you call her, is next door to starving?  Were
these falsehoods? were you imposing on my
credulity that you refuse real tangible help when
it comes?"
</p>

<p>
"I only refuse what is impossible for me to
accept," returned Queenie in a choking voice.
"Ah, you cannot understand, you do not know,
that since that terrible night I have nearly lost
Emmie."  And then she told him, as well as
emotion would allow her, of all she had been
through.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! that's why you have grown thin
and unsubstantial-looking.  I thought there was
some change in you.  You ought to get heavy
damages from those women; but the child is
getting well, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but she is not strong, and requires the
greatest care.  No one could watch over her as I
do; I understand her; I know her every look; I
see directly she is weary or overdone.  It will be
months before I can safely leave her, even with
Mr. Runciman and Molly."
</p>

<p>
"I should think the atmosphere of that
precious school could not be conducive to the
welfare of a nervous invalid," interrupted
Mr. Calcott irritably.
</p>

<p>
"We shall not be there much longer," returned
Queenie quietly.  "At Easter we are going to
Mr. Runciman's for a little visit; and as soon
as the warm weather comes I'm going to take
Emmie into the country to get strong."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I did not know you could afford such
luxuries," with biting sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
Queenie colored, but she went on steadily&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Neither can we.  We are indebted to the
kindness of a school friend, who has offered to
take us home.  I have barely money for our
railway journey there and back; but we shall
manage somehow."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Calcott glanced at the girl's shabby dress
and cloak, then at the brave face, and somehow
his sarcasm vanished.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are too proud to take a five-pound
note?" somewhat brusquely.
</p>

<p>
Queenie hesitated, and then her face grew crimson.
</p>

<p>
"Speak out; you are too proud, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I would not take it for myself, but for
Emmie's sake I should be thankful."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing about Emmie," with a
frown.  "If you take it it is for yourself mind;
the child is nothing to me; I cannot and will
not recognize her."
</p>

<p>
"If I take it it will be to buy her comforts,"
replied Queenie, scrupulously.
</p>

<p>
"Spend it how you will, it is nothing to me,"
was the irritable answer.  "I have made you
a good offer to-night.  By the sacrifice of a
few months you could earn enough to maintain
both the child and yourself for more than a year
to come, and you choose to refuse the offer.  I
can say no more."
</p>

<p>
"I dare not accept it.  If anything were to
happen to Emmie, I should never forgive myself.
Mamma always told me that we must never
leave a certain duty for an uncertain one; and
Emmie is my duty."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! female sophistry.  The child would
do well enough; children always do."
</p>

<p>
Queenie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It goes to my heart to refuse you.  If I were
free I would come and serve you, not only for
the sake of the money, but because mamma
loved you so dearly."
</p>

<p>
"There, there; I can bear no more," returned
the invalid impatiently.
</p>

<p>
Queenie took the hint and rose.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry if I have tired you.  May I come
again?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; come again to-morrow at the same
time.  Tell Runciman that he is to bring the
business letters here in the morning instead of
Smiler.  Please ring the bell for Mrs. Morton,
and be careful to close the door very carefully,
as the least noise jars on me.  What are you
waiting for now, child?"
</p>

<p>
"I only thought I should like to shake hands
with you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"There, good-night," was the brusque response;
but the hand was cold and shaking, as
the warm girlish one closed round it.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, and thank you for Emmie,"
returned Queenie, brightly.
</p>

<p>
Caleb sat up and rubbed his eyes drowsily as
the girl entered.  "How long you have been,
Miss Queenie, dear!  What has he been saying
to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I will tell you as we go along.  He is
very ill&mdash;dying, Caleb, and it is very, very sad to
see him.  Look what he has given me," opening
her hand and showing the crisp bank-note; "I
think he meant it as a sort of return for bringing
me out in the wet, but of course I shall not keep
it; it is all for Emmie."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's visits to Mr. Calcott became almost
a daily recurrence.  It soon became a rule for
Caleb to fetch her when lessons were over and
Emmie was asleep, to sit with the invalid an
hour before he retired to rest.  Miss Titheridge
had probably received some private hint from
Caleb, for she made no objection to these
frequent absences; but, on the contrary,
encouraged them by gracious enquiries after
Mr. Calcott's health when she encountered
Queenie.
</p>

<p>
The girl soon grew used to these visits.
Mr. Calcott, it is true, never varied in his manner.
He still received her brusquely, and his remarks
were as pungent and sarcastic as ever, with a
strange bitterness that often brought tears to her
eyes; but still, in a vague, uncertain sort of way,
she felt he liked to have her there beside him.
Once or twice she fancied his eyes had brightened
at her approach, even while he scolded her
querulously for being late.  He accepted her services
reluctantly, and often found fault with her for
feminine awkwardness.  Her efforts never gave
him pleasure.  No word of commendation crossed
his lips, no thanks for the unselfishness that
brought her out evening after evening, after a
hard day's work, to minister to a discontented
old man; and yet Queenie felt rewarded if his
eyes turned wistfully to the door as she entered,
or a sigh of relief betrayed that his loneliness
was at an end.
</p>

<p>
"Master has been that restless that Morton
can do nothing to please him," Gurnel informed
her once when she was unusually late.  Queenie
smiled and quickened her steps; she knew what
she had to expect.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you have got tired of your good
work," was the only welcome she received: but
Queenie had learned how to parry such remarks
without rousing the old man's jealous temper.
She turned the subject laughingly, by telling
him of the purchases she had made out of the
money he had given her.
</p>

<p>
"What! all those things out of five pounds!"
he grunted incredulously; "frock, jacket, and
hat, and I don't know what beside.  I thought
I said the money was for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Emmie is so delighted with everything," she
went on.  "The pleasure brought a tinge of
color to her face; it would have done you good
to have seen her."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  I dare say there will be much good
done to me to-night, after being kept an hour
waiting for other folk's pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Work must be done, you know," returned
Queenie lightly.  "The term is nearly over, and
then I shall be more at leisure."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, is the grand visit to be given
up?"&mdash;sarcastically; but there was suppressed
eagerness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there is a whole month before that; we
need not talk of that yet.  Now let me read to
you;" but though the book was an interesting
one, and Queenie read in her best manner,
Mr. Calcott's thoughts seemed wandering.
</p>

<p>
When the last day of the term arrived the
sisters left Granite Lodge.  Emmie, who had
been in a state of pleasurable excitement all the
morning, grew a little tearful and silent towards
the close of the day.
</p>

<p>
Queenie, who was overwhelmed with business,
and had scarcely time to bid her friend good-bye,
and add a few words as to future arrangement, at
parting, suddenly missed Emmie in her usual
corner.  She had searched the house without
success, and was becoming terribly frightened,
when a maid informed her that she had seen
Emmie toiling up the garret stairs with the
kitten in her arms.
</p>

<p>
The little girl was curled up in her usual place,
gazing dreamingly out of the window, when
Queenie entered.  The little face looked small
and white under the cap-border; the soft yellow
down peeping out here and there gave her an
infantile appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Emmie, why have you come here?"
began her sister, reprovingly; but Emmie held up
her finger and stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! of course we ought to say good-bye
to the poor old place; don't you know prisoners
sometimes kiss the walls of their cell, though they
are really not sorry to leave it.  We have had
nice times here, Queen, though we have been so
very unhappy.  As I sat here before you came
up, I felt as though there must be two Emmie's;
I feel so different to the old one that used to hide
her face and cry when it got dark."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will not stay and make ourselves
miserable in this gloomy place," interrupted
Queenie, anxiously.  "Caleb will be here directly,
and we must go and say good-bye to Miss
Titheridge.  Come, Em, come," and Emmie
obeyed reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
Miss Titheridge looked embarassed and nervous,
and Queenie purposely shortened their
leave-taking.  When Emmie's turn came she held up
her face to be kissed.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she said, looking at the governess
with her large serious blue eyes.  "Thank you
for being kind to me at last.  I am so sorry you
could not love me; but I dare say it was my
fault;" and as Miss Titheridge bent over her
something beside a kiss was left on the child's
thin cheek.
</p>

<p>
Caleb's little house seemed a perfect haven of
refuge that night.  Queenie felt almost too happy
as she arranged their effects in the little dark
room that Caleb had set apart for his guests.  It
seemed wrong of her to be so light-hearted while
the future was so uncertain.
</p>

<p>
Emmie lay in the big brown bed, with ugly
drab curtains edged with green, and watched her
as she moved about actively, singing over her
work.  The room had a side window looking
over a stone-mason's yard; the white monuments
gleamed in the red evening light; a laburnum
shook long sprays of gold against the panes;
Molly's linnet sung against the wall; Caleb in
his old coat walked contentedly up and down the
narrow garden path between his currant-bushes;
some children were playing among the slabs and
ledges of stone.  How humble it was, and yet
how peaceful; a quiet waiting-place until the new
work came ready to her hand.  One evening, as
she was sitting sewing at the open window,
Caleb beckoned her mysteriously to join him in
his favorite walk between the currant-bushes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," he began, his eyes becoming round
as usual, and betraying a tendency to hesitate
slightly between his words, "I want your advice,
your assistance, indeed.  I have&mdash;hem&mdash;I may
say&mdash;I have a delicate and peculiar commission
on hand,&mdash;hem,&mdash;and I&mdash;in short, a lady's advice
would be most suitable, and, I may say, satisfactory.
Molly is a good creature," he continued,
after a pause, "an admirable creature, of course;
but in this her advice is of such a nature that I
must own I should hesitate to adopt it.  She is
fond of bright colors, you see; and as long as
there is plenty of red and green in a pattern she
would find no fault."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to choose a new dress for
Molly?  I suppose that is what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Molly! oh dear, no! nothing of the kind,
Miss Queenie dear.  The fact is, a young friend of
mine, is&mdash;hem&mdash;is, in short, going to be married,
that is, she is going to be married some day, no
doubt."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed! a friend of yours, do you say?"  Caleb
nodded still more mysteriously.
</p>

<p>
"The circumstances are peculiar; yes, I am
certainly right in saying they are peculiar,"
continued Caleb, reflecting; "but she&mdash;that is,
he&mdash;has commissioned me to get her some things
suitable to a lady in such a position, as the same
peculiar circumstances prevent her from choosing
the articles herself.  She is not going to be
married yet," rubbing his head with a little
vexed perplexity; "but she is going on a visit
to his friends, and he&mdash;the young man I mean.
Ah! that's it," with a chuckle, as though he had
discovered a way out of some difficulty&mdash;"he,
the young man, my dear, has a proper pride, and
wants her to make a favourable impression on
his relations; do you see, Miss Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"Is she so very poor?" returned Queenie,
innocently, and not at all suspecting the veracity
of Caleb's garbled-up tale.
</p>

<p>
"Poor! well I may say that she is poor&mdash;extremely
so," with a burst of candor; "but a
lady,&mdash;dear, dear,&mdash;as much a lady as yourself,
Miss Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought her lover could have
chosen some pretty things for her himself,"
observed Queenie, a little incredulously, at this
juncture.  "He must be a poor sort of lover," she
thought, "to devolve such an interesting duty
on her old friend."
</p>

<p>
Caleb coughed, and stopped to inspect a promising
gooseberry bush; and then he discovered
his pipe was out, and must replenish it; it was
quite five minutes, too, before it would draw
properly, and Queenie got impatient for her
question to be answered.
</p>

<p>
"Why cannot he get them himself?" she
enquired, a little scornfully; "he need not have
troubled you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, a man with a broken leg is not
particularly active, and shopping does not suit
the complaint," was the oracular answer, as Caleb
puffed volumes of smoke, bravely.  "No, no,
that sort of thing is not good for the complaint,"
continued the old man, with another chuckle;
"so you see, Miss Queenie dear, if you don't help
me a bit with your advice I shall have to go to
Molly after all, and shall come back with a plaid
satin, or something that wouldn't suit the pretty
creature at all.  Come, now,"&mdash;coaxingly,&mdash;"what
should you think she would like best?"
</p>

<p>
Queenie wrinkled her white forehead reflectively,&mdash;poor
and pretty, and with a lover laid up
at a distance.  This began to get interesting;
she must do her best to help this unknown girl.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I were judging for myself," she
returned at last, "I should think a nice useful
black silk&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is just it," interrupted Caleb,
enthusiastically.  "I ought to have thought of
that; of course, a black silk."
</p>

<p>
"And," continued Queenie, now thoroughly
absorbed in a mental review of this ideal wardrobe,
"a pretty spring suit,&mdash;brown, I think, if it
would suit her,&mdash;and a brown hat with a
pheasant wing.  I think she would look nice in
that."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, of course; the idea of my never
thinking of brown," repeated Caleb, clapping his
hands, "the very color of all others that would
suit her.  Go on, Miss Queenie dear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose her lover does not wish to
be extravagant, it is not her trousseau, you see;
some nice collars and cuffs and ties, and perhaps
handkerchiefs, and some brown gloves&mdash;and, oh! she
must have a box to put them in.  If she be
so very poor, you see, it will not do for her to
dress too handsomely," observed the young girl,
sententiously.
</p>

<p>
Caleb dashed down his pipe, and very nearly
executed a <i>pas de seul</i> on the garden path; his
blue eyes danced with glee.
</p>

<p>
"There now, there now; did I not say you
had a wise head, Miss Queenie!  The very thing
of all other! a box!&mdash;and Molly and I would never
have thought of it&mdash;a really good handsome box
that would make the luggage porters stare, eh?"
enquiring.
</p>

<p>
"Well no; a nice black leather one, like
Cathy's, I think," returned Queenie, with quiet
relish.  During the remainder of the evening, as
she sat over some plain sewing she was doing for
Emmie, she thought of Caleb's friend a little
enviously, and wondered how she would like the
nice things.  She wished Caleb would tell her a
little more about her; but, to her surprise, he
did not recur again to the subject.
</p>

<p>
About a fortnight after this conversation, as
she returned from her usual evening visit to
Mr. Calcott, she paused for a moment at the door of
her room, transfixed in surprise.
</p>

<p>
A large leathern trunk blocked up the room;
two white letters, Q.M., stared her full in the
face; a sudden revelation of the truth drove the
flush to her very brow.
</p>

<p>
Could it really be?  She lifted the lid gingerly,
almost trembling with excitement; her hand
came in contact with the folds of a black silk;
lower down lay the brown dress and jacket; the
little hat with its pheasant plume nestled snugly
in one division.  Queenie had just a hurried peep
at piles of snowy handkerchiefs, and collars, and
cuffs, at French gloves, and soft streaks of color
in the shape of silken scarfs, and then she rushed
breathlessly down into the parlor, where Emmie
was reading fairy tales to Caleb.
</p>

<p>
Emmie put down her book and clapped her
hands at the sight of Queenie's face.  Caleb's
eyes twinkled over his pipe, but he said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queen, isn't it lovely! better even than
Cinderella's pumpkin coach.  Isn't it a dear, dear
secret, for Caleb and me to have kept all this
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the young man with the
broken leg will be satisfied with my taste,"
chuckled the old man.  Queenie put her arms
round his neck, her face was rosy with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Caleb, is it for me! really for me! the
box with all those beautiful things?  Did you
buy it for me, dear, because you knew I was so
poor and shabby, and you did not like me to go
among those strange people with my old clothes?
Oh, Caleb, how could you, how could you, and
you so poor yourself?" caressing him gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Queenie, dear," confessed the old man,
with tears in his eyes, "if I had the money I
would not begrudge you satin and diamonds;
nothing would be too good for you, my pretty;
nothing that old Caleb would not get you; but
it is not me, bless your dear heart, that you have
to thank for all your things."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's face fell, her arms dropped to her
side.
</p>

<p>
"Not you, Caleb?"
</p>

<p>
"Why no," he returned, slightly embarrassed;
"I would have bought them and gladly if I had
had the money, which I am free to confess is not
the case.  You have another and a richer friend
at court than old Caleb."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to tell me," replied Queenie,
sitting down, quite pale with the surprise,
"that&mdash;that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I knew you would guess it!" interrupted
Caleb, sagaciously.  "'Find out what she requires
for her visit, and get it, Runciman,' he said to
me; and, as I observed once before on a similar
occasion, you might have knocked me over with
a feather.  'Ask some woman to help you, for we
neither of us know much of a girl's farthingales
and furbelows, I fancy,' he said, grimly enough;
and so, my dear, I made bold, and invented that
pleasing little fiction in order to get at some of
your ideas."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Calcott has given me all those things?"
she repeated; and then for the moment she could
say no more.
</p>

CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
"THE LITTLE COMFORTER."
</h3>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On her next visit, which was to be her last before
they started for Hepshaw, Mr. Calcott received
Queenie with more than his usual acrimony.
</p>

<p>
"In my time punctuality used to be considered
a virtue," he said, severely, with an ominous
glance at the time-piece, which showed Queenie
she was some minutes late.  "Never mind; I
dare say this is the last time you will have to
amuse a troublesome old man."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's eyes filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't talk so, Mr. Calcott; not to-night,
at least, when I have to bid you good-bye
for so many weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, you will be very sorry for that, no
doubt," ironically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she returned, with the sweet candor
natural to her; "far more sorry than I would
have expected or believed."
</p>

<p>
He laughed a low, bitter laugh, that went to
the girl's heart.
</p>

<p>
"And you think I shall credit that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not? one must always believe the
truth," she returned, simply.  "When I first
came here I pitied you dreadfully, and yet I was
half afraid of you.  I do not fear you at all
now."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Your moroseness used to terrify, but now I
do not seem to mind all your hard words; they
lurk under kind actions, and so they have lost
their sting.  It was kindness that prompted you
to send me all those pretty things."
</p>

<p>
"Humph, I see the reason for all this civility now."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's eyes rested tenderly on the worn,
cadaverous face.
</p>

<p>
"You see I am longing to thank you, and yet
I hardly know how to do so without giving you
offence."
</p>

<p>
"I hate thanks," gruffly.  "There, girl, that
will do; let us get to our reading," and Queenie,
who saw that unusual suffering lay at the bottom
of the old man's bitter humor, did not venture
to thwart him just then.
</p>

<p>
When the time came for her to go she put
the marker in the book carefully, and leant over
him.  As she touched him softly with her hand,
he started and opened his eyes; they had a
strange, almost a wild look in them for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I could have sworn it was Emily's hand," he
muttered.  "Hers was always soft and warm,
like the breast of a little bird.  Pshaw! what
rubbish I am talking; you have read me to sleep,
child; I have been dreaming."
</p>

<p>
"Let me give you your draught, and talk to
you a little; to-morrow I am going away, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, to-morrow, and a good many
to-morrows."  She still held the cold, nerveless
fingers in hers, and her voice was very gentle in
his ear.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not like to think you are missing me;
when evening comes I shall wish I were here
beside you, reading to you and lulling your pain.
It seems to me," continued the girl, speaking
still more softly, "as though in some strange
way, and out of strange circumstances, we have
grown to be friends."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, and turned restlessly on his pillow,
but there was no repulse.
</p>

<p>
"You have been very good to me, and I shall
love to remember your goodness.  I think
mamma was right when she said you had a
heart.  To-morrow I am going away&mdash;as you
know&mdash;for a long, long time, and I want you to
do me a favor."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  I will do nothing blindfold," with a
return of his old harshness; but, under the
half-closed eyelids, how he watched it&mdash;the bright
speaking face!
</p>

<p>
"I want you to see Emmie.  Hush! do not
refuse," as he gave utterance to an expression
of impatience, almost disgust; "do not send me
away less happy; do not refuse such a trifling
request.  If I have ever pleased you, if I have
ever wiled away an hour of bitter pain, grant me
this one favour: let the child stand here for a
moment beside you."
</p>

<p>
"Can you not leave a dying man in peace?"
he began savagely, but his wrath faded before
the girl's mild glance.  A brief spasm as of pain
contracted his forehead, and his eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
"Have your foolish whim," he muttered at
last, almost inaudibly.  "But what have I to do
with children?  I always hated them."
</p>

<p>
"You will not hate Emmie," returned Queenie
as she hurriedly rose; "it is a fine evening, and
she pleaded for me to bring her; 'she wanted to
see poor Uncle Andrew,' she said."
</p>

<p>
"Tell her not to call me that," he exclaimed,
angrily; but Queenie had already closed the door
behind her.
</p>

<p>
Another minute, and the child stood beside
his couch.  The evening sun shone full upon her;
she had grown tall and thin from her long illness;
the beautiful fair hair had been shaved off, but
the soft yellow down peeped under the pretty
cap border; the great blue eyes had a solemn,
unchildlike look in them; a little wasted hand
crept into the sick man's, and then patted it
softly.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! so you are better, aye, after nearly
frightening that sister of yours to death," with
a milder growl than Queenie expected.
</p>

<p>
"I am much better, thank you, Uncle Andrew,"
returned Emmie, gravely; and then, perfectly
undaunted by the grim, death-like face on the
pillow before her, she clambered up on the
bed beside it, and sat perched before him like a
large soft-eyed bird.  "Queenie thought I was
going to die, and cried dreadfully every night;
Cathy told me so.  Are you going to die, Uncle
Andrew?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems so," with a chord of ineffable
bitterness rasping the thin voice.
</p>

<p>
Emmie leaned forward and stroked his face
pityingly, with an old-fashioned womanliness
that touched her sister greatly.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry; it seems such a pity, just as
we were going to be fond of you; it will be so
strange, too, missing you out of my prayers every
night, not that it will do any harm to go on
saying, 'God bless you,' even after you are
dead," continued Emmie, reflectively, and in a
slightly puzzled tone.  "I asked Queenie about
that, and she said she was not sure."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his iron nerve Mr. Calcott winced
slightly.  This mere babe was playing round the
feet of the king of Terror, while he was quailing
secretly at the thought of the skeleton hand
raised ready to strike: it would find him in his
darkness and loneliness; his truest friend would
come to him in the guise of an enemy.  He was
not a weak man, but at this moment the thought
of his solitary death-bed caused him to thrill
with premonitory pain and anguish.  And then,
with an odd transition of idea, he remembered
how one night, when he was a lad, he had been
wakened from his sleep by an awful storm; and
his little sister Emily had come crying to his
bed-side, and had clung to him in an agony of
terror.  He remembered, as though it were
yesterday, the little shivering figure in white,
the tangled fair hair under the cap border, the
childish voice broken with sobs, "Oh Andrew,
dear Andrew, take care of me; I am so
frightened."
</p>

<p>
"You are only a girl, Emmie; boys and men
are never frightened; why I don't know what
fear is," he had returned, half scoffingly, and yet
proud to shield her, and to feel himself strong in
his boy's strength.
</p>

<p>
Ah, he knew what fear meant now.  He
thought, with the cold clammy sweat of superstitious
terror, of what the coffin lid would cover;
while a child's lips blessed him&mdash;him, Andrew
Calcott, dead, unloved, and unremembered&mdash;blessed
him in her prayers.
</p>

<p>
God pardon his wasted, misused life, he
groaned, and grant him one single fragment of
opportunity more, and he should not be
unremembered; and the flicker of a strange smile
curved Andrew Calcott's lips as he silently
registered this vow.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sleepy or tired, Uncle Andrew?"
asked Emmie, rather awe-stricken by the long
silence and closed eye-lids, and still more by the
smile.  "When you lay like that, so still and
white," continued the child, "you reminded me
of the figure of the old Crusader&mdash;a knight I think
he was&mdash;on the tomb I saw once in church.  Do
you know what I was thinking about when I
watched you?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I was wondering if you felt afraid&mdash;to die,
I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Well, child; what then?" regarding her
strangely.
</p>

<p>
"I used to be terribly afraid, you know,"
creeping closer, and whispering confidentially.
"When I sat alone in the old garret,&mdash;ah, the
poor old garret; I don't hate it quite so much
now,&mdash;and it got dark, and the silence had odd
voices in it, I used to think about mamma and
want to go to her; only I could not get to her
without dying, and that troubled me."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Emmie," interrupted her sister, softly;
but Mr. Calcott waved her aside, and bade her
let the child speak, and Queenie drew back again
into the shade of the curtain.
</p>

<p>
"I used to sit for ever so long, and fancy how
it would be.  I fainted once; and then I thought
it would be like that, only I was afraid I should
feel terribly cold and lonely when I woke and
found myself alone in a strange place, however
beautiful it might be; and then Queenie took
me to see that picture, and after that I did not
mind at all."
</p>

<p>
"What picture, little one?"
</p>

<p>
"Of a girl, not much older than I, asleep with
her arms so,"&mdash;crossing hers gravely over her
breast,&mdash;"and sliding up a great pathway of
light, just as I saw a little boat once floating in
the moonlight.  Fancy floating asleep between
the stars, and right into heaven!"
</p>

<p>
A half-groan answered the child, but she was
too absorbed to notice it.
</p>

<p>
"I never forgot the picture; it made me so
happy to think of it.  I shall not mind dying a
bit now; I shall just cross my arms, as the girl
did, and shut my eyes, and when I wake up
I shall see mamma smiling at the door; and
perhaps," finished the child solemnly, "He will
come to me, instead of letting me go very far in
the great dazzling place to find Him."
</p>

<p>
"Him!"
</p>

<p>
"Our Lord, you know; I shall want to see Him
most.  Uncle Andrew, when I say my prayers
to-night I shall tell Him that you are afraid, and
ask Him to let mamma be the first to meet you;
and not a great splendid angel with wings, but
just mamma, looking, oh, so beautiful! and
smiling as she used to smile."
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, child; there, leave me; take
her away, or I will not answer for myself.  I
have the pain again; those drops, quick!  Oh,
merciful heavens! only the boon of another day,
one more day."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! you are only agitating yourself; you
are not really worse," returned Queenie, tenderly,
wiping the moisture from his forehead.  "If you
calm yourself the attack will pass off.  Emmie,
darling, you must leave him now; he is too tired
to talk any more;" and the child gently obeyed,
after kissing him timidly on the cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You must go too, I suppose," laying a
delaying hand on her dress nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but it is only good-bye for a little
while," returned Queenie, trying to speak
cheerfully, but her eyes filling with tears.  "When I
come back we must have some more nice talks,
and quiet cosy times together.  You will miss
me; I am sorry and grieved to think how you
will miss me," finished the girl, faltering sadly
over her words; "but Emmie and I will think of
you and talk of you all the time we are away."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, do; but it is good-bye for all that," he
returned, with a strange look at her.  "You have
meant well by me, I believe; thank you for all
you have done for me."
</p>

<p>
"No, no; it has been so little, and it has made
me happy to do it," exclaimed Queenie, and now
the tears fairly brimmed over.  As he held her
hand in the weak, nerveless grasp of old age she
stooped over him, with an infinite yearning of
pity and sorrow, and kissed him softly on the
forehead, as a daughter might have done.
</p>

<p>
In the years to come Queenie never regretted
that kiss.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
CHURCH-STILE HOUSE.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"If we were to form an image of dignity in a man, we should
give him wisdom and valor, as being essential to the character
of manhood.  In the like manner, if you describe a right
woman in a laudable sense, she should have gentle softness,
tender fear, and all those parts of life which distinguish her
from the other sex; with some subordination to it, but such
an infirmity that makes her still more lovely."&mdash;<i>Sir Richard
Steele.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was with somewhat mixed feelings that
Queenie bade farewell to her old friend Caleb
Runciman the next day; and even Emmie looked
back regretfully at the little dark house.
</p>

<p>
"I shall never love any other quite so well:
shall you, Queen?  I cannot bear big houses
and large halls.  We shall miss Caleb and Molly
dreadfully; but then we shall only be a month
away."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! a month is a long time; a great deal
may happen in it," returned her sister thoughtfully,
a little awe mingled with her pleasure.
They were going to a strange place, amidst
unknown faces; they would make new friends, feel
fresh interests, think new thoughts.
</p>

<p>
They, too, were standing hand in hand on the
threshold of a new world&mdash;a world full of all
manner of delightful possibilities; they had
broken with the dreary past, and now the future
lay before them.  Queenie took off her pretty
brown hat and bared her forehead to the breeze
with a little gasp.  "How nice it is to feel young
and strong and free.  You and I are free, Emmie;
yes, free as this delicious wind," finished the
young girl with a little quiver of ecstasy in her
voice.
</p>

<p>
A thousand vague imaginations flitted across
her mind as she sat watching the flying mile-stones,
while Emmie, wearied out with excitement,
slept with her head upon Queenie's shoulder.
"I feel afraid of nothing to-day; I am sure I
shall find work; I do not mind how humble or
hard it is.  I think I feel young for the first time.
After all, there are only two things to fear in
life&mdash;debt and unkindness.  A few loving words will
sweeten even a crust of bread and a cup of water.
Emmie and I will not mind a little hardship if
we can only be together; but how nearly I lost
my treasure," with an involuntary shudder that
roused Emmie.  She sat up and rubbed her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I think this must be Hepshaw, we are going
more slowly; what a little journey, Queen!  Oh,
yes; there is Cathy on the platform, looking into
all the carriages.  She does not see us; what
fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed she does, Emmie; she is laughing
and nodding at us.  Let me help you out, dear;"
but almost before she descended from the carriage
she felt herself seized by a pair of arms, and
Cathy's bright face confronted her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you dear things! to think you have
really arrived!  I have been here at least an
hour and a half, till the station-master thought I
must have taken leave of my senses.  I would
have it the train was due at three.  Give me a
kiss, Emmie.  Bless me! how that child grows.
My dear Queen," eyeing her with intense curiosity
and satisfaction, "if you are not ashamed of
walking with me in my old hat I think we will
move on, as they say in London."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, if you will lead the way," returned
Queenie politely; but her friend remained still
in the same attitude of delighted astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, when I have recovered a little; but
whatever will Langley say?  I feel I am bringing
you to the house under false pretences; the
victim of misfortune appears suddenly in the garb
of an elegant female, with a golden pheasant's
plume in her hat.  You lovely old Queen! you
look so nice that I quite long to hug you.  Ted
will be fairly overpowered when he sees us."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, really you must not talk such nonsense,"
returned Queenie, blushing; "the man is
waiting for our tickets, and Emmie is tired."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now I recognize Madam Dignity, of
Granite Lodge.  Come along, then, through this
little gate.  We have to wait at the Deer-hound
inn for a few minutes till Ted and the waggonette
come up from Warstdale; that is where
Garth's granite quarry is.  Garth is so sorry that
he could not meet you himself."
</p>

<p>
Queenie did not answer; she felt a little shy
and silent all of a sudden.  She followed Cathy
down the steep little road bordered with plane
trees, and cumbered with piles of neatly-hewn
planks, to the grey old inn.  What a quiet country
corner it looked, she thought.  The village, or
market town as it really was, lay beyond; a long
road went stretching away into the distance;
across the road were granaries, and a sunny little
garden; a hen with a family of yellow ducklings
were scratching in the dust; dark clumps of
plane trees were everywhere.  The grey old
landlord stood regarding them from the porch; the
comely hostess came bustling out to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, Miss Clayton; the waggonette isn't
here yet, and it is a bit hot in the sun.
Mr. Logan passed just now on his way to the quarry
and he would have it his big umbrella did not
shelter him at all."
</p>

<p>
"It is sure to be full of holes," returned Cathy
carelessly, as she led the way into the inn.
Queenie had a glimpse as she passed of a long,
low-ceiled room with cross-beams and a deep
window, and then of the great stone kitchen with
its long settle and wide open fireplace.  As they
followed the landlady up the broad staircase
Emmie clapped her hands delightfully.
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful room!  I never saw a glass
cupboard of china before like that; and there are
two tables and rocking-chairs; and oh, dear! what
a hard, slippery sofa, and what a funny,
cracked piano; and, I do declare, there are at
least four or five large silver tea-pots, and a great
stand of wax flowers."
</p>

<p>
"This is where they have the agricultural
dinners and do all the speechifying.  Sit down,
Queenie, do; how I wish that long laddie of ours
would drive up; but it is just like Ted, to be late
for everything."
</p>

<p>
"I do not mind waiting," returned her friend
quietly.  She was quite as much excited as Cathy
and Emmie, though she did not show it as they
did.  She stood looking out of the small-paned
window, through the screen of red geraniums, at
the sunny little garden across the road.
</p>

<p>
Two buxom lasses were carrying piles of white,
freshly-dried linen to the inn; the patient hen
was still clucking devotedly at the heels of her
foster-family; some long-necked geese waddled
aimlessly across the road; a sweet odor of fresh
hay came from the granary in front; the trampling
of hoofs and the loud cool swishes of water,
mingled with the hissing of a red-headed ostler,
sounded from the stable-yard.  Queenie looked
out dreamily, until the noise of advancing wheels
broke on her ear.
</p>

<p>
Cathy started up.
</p>

<p>
"There is Ted! look at him brandishing his
whip and making up for lost time by driving
furiously.  What a shame to treat poor old
Minnie so! she is quite covered with foam.  Ted,
you tiresome fellow, what do you mean by
keeping my friends waiting?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your friends' pardon; am I late?  Nonsense,
Cath, you are such a one to exaggerate;
come, jump in.  Where's the luggage?  Give a
hand, you fellows there, and stow in the traps;
the mare's fidgetty, and won't stand."
</p>

<p>
"No wonder, when you have fretted her to a
fever; you would catch it from Garth if he saw her.
Now then, Ted, where are your manners? this is
Miss Marriott and her little sister Emmie."
</p>

<p>
The young man took off his straw hat rather
gravely, and then descended leisurely from the
vehicle, and commenced stroking the mare's
neck, casting furtive glances at the new-comers
as he did so.
</p>

<p>
He was a mere boy, as Cathy had described
him, barely twenty; his sister's name of the
"long laddie" suited him perfectly, for he was
certainly the tallest specimen of youthful manhood
that Queenie had ever seen; his slenderness
added to his height, he towered above them like
a boy giant.
</p>

<p>
Queenie liked his face; it was good-looking,
though somewhat freckled, with a pair of mild
brown eyes; at the present it manifested nothing
but an expression of obstinate good-humor.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, Cathy, jump in; the mare won't
stand, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why we are to hurry ourselves,"
replied his sister, provokingly.  "Did you meet
Mr. Logan on the Warstdale road, Ted?"
</p>

<p>
Ted laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Christopher? yes; there he was,
trudging away, with his blue spotted handkerchief
tucked under his felt hat, and the sun scorching
him through the rents in his umbrella, and his
boots white with dust, such a figure of fun."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have insisted on bringing him
back; he will have a sunstroke.  Think of Miss
Cosie's feeling," and Cathy looked a little grave.
"You are such a child, Ted; you never think of
anything.  Now drive slowly through the town,
that I may point out the various landmarks to
Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"Ted followed his instructions <i>au pied de la
lettre</i>, by proceeding at a funeral pace, while
Minnie snorted indignantly at her driver's tight
hand, and whisked her tail angrily at the flies.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! do go on a little faster, Ted; every one
will be staring at us if we go at this ridiculous
pace," pleaded his sister, trying hard to be
dignified and not to laugh.  These passages in arms
between her and her younger brother were not
new in the household.  Queenie was amused to
see that he merely pushed his hand through his
rough light hair and jogged on at the same pace.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had plenty of time to note the
surroundings, though she persisted then, and long
afterwards, in regarding Hepshaw as a village,
in spite of its dignity as a market-town.  She
admired the game-keeper's white house, set so
prettily among the sycamores, or plane trees,
and the picturesque police-station, with its cottage
porch and bright-bordered flower-garden.
</p>

<p>
The long broad road, with its stone cottages
and small substantial houses, set so snugly in
patches of garden ground, pleased her greatly;
everything looked so fresh and still.  By-and-bye
they came to the market-place, with its few
bright-looking shops, and the boys' school-house; just
opposite was a curious little building with small
half-moon windows, that Queenie took for the
market, but which proved to be the girls' school.
</p>

<p>
"I think it was used for the market once
upon a time," explained Cathy; "is it not a
queer little place? those high crescent-shaped
windows are so absurd.  Look behind you, Queen;
that is the prettiest peep of all," as she pointed
to some green meadows, behind which were the
church, vicarage, and another house, standing
high above the town, and perfectly embosomed
with trees.
</p>

<p>
The road branched into two now; further on
were some still more picturesque cottages, and
even a villa or two, but the mare was jogging up
a steep country road now, and in another moment
they were driving across a tiny moat and into a
court-yard, bordered with a row of dark sycamores,
with a side glimpse of a steep little house
adjoining the church-yard.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome to Church-Stile House.  Isn't it a
gloomy old place? and yet Langley and I love it.
Oh! there is Langley," as a black clad figure,
taller and more erect even than Cathy's, came
swiftly down the garden path towards them.
</p>

<p>
"How late you all are; I have been expecting
you for an hour at least.  I am so glad you have
come, Miss Marriott; Cathy is never weary of
talking about her friends.  So this is really
Emmie?" kissing the child and holding, out a
cordial hand to Queenie.
</p>

<p>
The voice was sweet and pleasant, the accent
singularly refined; nevertheless, the first sight of
Langley Clayton gave Queenie a curious shock.
The likeness between the sisters was striking,
but it was a likeness that pained rather than
pleased; it was Cathy's face grown prematurely
old, and deprived of color and animation, a face
that had sharpened and grown weary under the
pressure of some carking care; the eyes were
gentle, but unrestful; the long wave of hair worn
over the forehead in Cathy's style was mixed
with grey.  The touch of the thin hot hand
lingered long on Queenie's palm.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad, so very glad, you have come,"
repeated Langley, with a soft flickering smile.
This flickering smile was peculiar to Langley; it
was all that ever broke up the subdued gravity
of manner habitual to her.  Queenie soon
discovered that she never laughed; when pleased
or excited this odd uncertain smile would play
tremulously round the mouth for a moment and
then fade away.
</p>

<p>
"It is so good of you to have us," returned
Queenie, feeling strangely subdued all of a
sudden, as she followed Langley's tall figure into
the square little hall, and then into a sitting-room,
pleasantly littered with books and work,
and with a certain old-fashioned cosiness in its
arrangements.  The deep basket-work chairs,
lined with chintz cushions, looked deliciously
inviting, and so did the low couch and
reading-table.  One high narrow window commanded a
view of the steep little lawn, running down to
the lane; the other, to Queenie's surprise, opened
full on the church-yard.  Within a few feet were
tall palings, and a granite obelisk; then some
sparsely-scattered tombstones, and a long terrace
bordered by sycamores, and known by the name
of the plane-tree walk.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid it strikes you as very dismal,"
said Langley, softly, as they stood together at
the windows; "most people consider the obelisk
a great eyesore.  A few years ago there was
not a single tombstone; it is only now that they
have begun to use the church-yard.  It was just
the church, and the green, and the plane-tree
walk; it was our garden then."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose one would get used to it in time,"
replied Queenie, somewhat evasively.  Her healthy
young vitality shivered a little at the incongruity
between the warm cosiness of the life inside and
the gleaming tombstones without, within a few
feet of the fireside round which the family circle
gathered.  "That terrace walk is very pretty, and
the old church must be nice; but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you think we ought always to be reading
Hervey's 'Meditations,' and considering our
latter end," broke in Cathy gaily.  "Nothing of
the kind, I assure you; Garth grumbles, and
declares he will build a new house for himself
higher up the hill, and Ted agrees with him;
but I don't mind it in the least, and Langley
likes it."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?" asked Queenie, fixing her large
brown eyes curiously on Langley's pale face.
</p>

<p>
"I love it," was the quiet answer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think of Langley?" asked
Cathy, when they had been duly installed in
their large comfortable room.  Miss Clayton had
left them, taking Emmie with her, after having
ministered to the child with her own hands.  Her
thoughtfulness for their comfort, and her gentle
manipulation of Emmie touched Queenie's heart;
they had gone off together hand in hand, Emmie
chattering confidentially to her new friend, and
Cathy and she had ensconced themselves cosily
on the low window-seat commanding a view of
the old church and church-yard.  Queenie liked
it better now; after all it was strangely peaceful,
God's Acre, as she loved to hear it called.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think of this sister of
mine?" repeated her friend enquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"It is too soon to ask my opinion; I have
not made up my mind.  Indeed I like her," as
Cathy looked a little crestfallen; "I should not
wonder if I like her better the more I know her;
her voice is delicious, so low and musical, with
a little trill in it, and her eyes looked so kindly
at one."
</p>

<p>
"You are a model of reserve and prudence, my
dear Madam Dignity.  I always make up my
mind the first minute whether I like a person or
not, and never swerve an inch from my like or
dislike afterwards; that is feminine instinct, as
I tell Garth.  He is as tiresome as you are; one
can never get at his opinion of a person till he
has thoroughly sifted and weighed them in a sort
of moral balance of his own."
</p>

<p>
"I must say I think that he is wise."
</p>

<p>
"He has strong prejudices though; small sins
are sometimes heinous in his eyes.  Garth's pride
is his chief fault; he is quite absurd on some
points.  I have heard him say, more than once,
that he would never marry a rich woman, however
much he cared for her; that a man should
never be beholden to his wife for anything but
love.  Isn't that absurd?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a fault on the right side."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense; I am tired of arguing the point
with him.  What has money to do in the case?
My husband might be as rich as Croesus, or as
poor as a church-mouse, but if I liked him I would
stick to him all the same.  It is wrong pride in a
man to let anything stand in the way if he likes
a woman; and Langley agrees with me."
</p>

<p>
"Does she?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she talks on these sort of subjects so
nicely; she is not a bit hard, as Garth is
sometimes.  He hates flirting and nonsense, and
scolds me dreadfully if I make myself too
amiable to any masculine individual; but Langley
always takes my part, and says I am only a
child; oh, she is a darling, or a saint, as
Mr. Logan says."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure she is nice," returned Queenie,
throwing a little enthusiasm into her voice.
Cathy's frankness was embarrassing.  That first
evening she would have found it impossible to
form any true opinion of Miss Clayton; she was
attracted and yet repelled by her, fascinated
oddly by her voice and manner, and yet pained
by a weariness and suppression for which there
seemed no words.  Was she unhappy or only
tired? was her life simply too monotonous for
her? had she wider yearnings that stretched
out further, and were still unsatisfied? had
responsibility and over-much thought for others
traced those worn lines, and wrinkled the
smooth forehead?  Queenie found herself
indulging in all manner of conjectures before
the evening was over.  That she was a woman
infinitely loved and respected was plainly
evident.  Langley's opinion, Langley's sympathy,
were always claimed, and never in vain; the
same patient attention, the same ready help,
were given to all.  She talked largely and
well, and with a certain originality that made
her an interesting companion; and there was
a breadth and large-mindedness about her
views that appealed strongly to Queenie's
admiration.
</p>

<p>
"I do like her; I am sure I shall like her,"
she repeated for the third time, when Cathy had
finished a long and animated harangue on her
sister's merits.  Cathy never stinted her praise;
she spread it richly for those she loved, with a
warmth of girlish hyperbole, and a generous
glazing-over of manifest defects, that was rather
refreshing in this censorious age.
</p>

<p>
"What was I saying?  Hush! there is Garth;
we must go down now," as a sudden melodious
whistle sounded from below, at once deftly and
sweetly answered by Cathy.  "That means tea is
ready, and his highness is hungry; come, we
must not keep th' maister waiting."
</p>

<p>
The long low-ceiled dining-room looked snug
and home-like as they entered.  A tempting meal
was spread for the travellers; a basket of roses
and ferns garnished the table; some canaries
sang in the window.  Ted Clayton's long figure
lounged in a rocking-chair; Emmie was standing
beside him, looking like a little Puritan girl
in her grey frock and close-bordered cap, making
friends with a white Maltese terrier; a tall
young man in a rough tweed coat leant over the
back of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott, this is my brother Garth,"
said Cathy, with an accent of pride in her voice,
and Garth came forward with a pleasant smile.
</p>

<p>
What a good, thoughtful face it was; certainly
Cathy had not exaggerated.  He was a handsome,
a very handsome, man; the chin was strongly
moulded, and the mouth closed firmly, perhaps a
trifle too firmly, under the dark moustache, but
the blue-grey eyes had an honest kindly gleam
in them; the strong brown hand grasped
Queenie's with open-hearted friendliness.
</p>

<p>
Then and afterwards Queenie marvelled to herself,
that Garth Clayton's face came to her as a
sudden revelation&mdash;with the instinctive
recognition&mdash;of God's noblest handiwork,&mdash;a really
good man, good, that is, as poor human nature
reads the word.
</p>

<p>
By-and-bye, when she knew him better, and all
his faults were mapped out legibly before her,
and she read him with the unerring light of a
woman's truest instinct, she ever gave him honor
as one who strove to walk nobly amongst his
fellows, who stood as a Saul among men, a head
and shoulders taller than they, by reason of the
integrity and strength of purpose that lay within
him.
</p>

<p>
"Keep innocency, and take heed to the thing
that is right, and that shall bring a man peace
at the last," were the words of the wise old King,
to which Garth Clayton had ever given heed,
keeping his hands clean with a whiteness that
scorned to sully itself; standing aloof from small
petty subterfuge and conventional untruths.
</p>

<p>
And yet there were strange blemishes in Garth
Clayton's nature apparent to those who loved
him.  There was the narrowness of a pride that
chose superiority rather than equality; that
would stand aloof willingly from his equals, to
rule, and rule wisely, over his inferiors; a born
autocrat; despotic, yet not unkindly; somewhat
tyrannical, unable to brook contradiction, childishly
eager for praise, sensitive to a fault, jealous
of dignity, and, by one of those strange subtilties
that baffle metaphysicians, ever through life
painfully conscious of hidden disadvantages.
For the clear intellect failed in depth and
breadth, the calm common sense read itself truly;
and, too proud to stoop to others for knowledge,
or to own ignorance, which it would have been
truly great to confess, Garth Clayton would
at times wrap himself round in a silent reserve
that often mystified and perplexed others.
</p>

<p>
But there was always one who understood him,
and that was Langley; and by-and-bye there
came another!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
MISS COSIE.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Well, to be sure, there never was a little woman so full of hope
and tenderness, and love and anxiety, as this little woman
was."&mdash;<i>Dickens.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next hour passed pleasantly enough; the
Claytons devoted themselves to their guests'
entertainment with an open-heartedness and
simple hospitality that seemed natural to them.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the seclusion in which they lived,
and the loneliness of their surroundings, they
showed a perfection of breeding and a freedom
of idea that surprised and delighted Queenie.
</p>

<p>
Her shyness and brief reserve soon vanished
under the influence of their kindness.  After the
first few minutes she ceased to feel as though
she were a stranger amongst them, and found
herself entering into their plans and wishes as
though she had known them for years.
</p>

<p>
"You see Cathy has talked to me about you
all, and that is why I feel that I know you," she
said, a little apologetically, lifting those strange
eyes of hers to Garth.  The young man flushed
a little, but answered her kindly.  Cathy's friend
was rather formidable to him; he had at least
never met any one in the least like Queenie
Marriott; he felt far more at home with Emmie.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, he hid his embarrassment in his
usual manner, as though half ashamed of it, by
holding his head higher than usual, and laying
down the law to his sisters in his dictatorial,
good-humored way.  Before tea was over Cathy
was coaxing him to give them a picnic in the
granite quarries, and he had hummed and
hesitated a good deal over her request, "just to
make himself of importance," whispered the
wicked little sister to Queenie.
</p>

<p>
This led to some conversation about the quarry
and quarry-men; and here Garth found himself
on his own ground, and talked much and
well.  He told Queenie, as they all strolled down
the lane in the twilight, after Emmie had gone
to bed, about his plans for the men's welfare
and improvement, "his boys," as he termed them.
</p>

<p>
There seemed no limits to the good he did
amongst them.  Queenie felt her respect for
him increase as she listened.  He had given up
one of his fields for cricket, and was himself their
captain.  He had instituted a reading-room; and
Mr. Logan and he had formed a useful library.
Here in the winter there were lectures given to
the men by the Vicar, and Captain Fawcett, a
neighbor of theirs, living in one of the villas
lower down; or he himself read to them amusing
passages from Dickens and Charles Lever.
Garth's reading was none of the finest, as
Queenie discovered for herself afterwards, and
his singing was even worse in quality; but he
would carry it through in a certain sturdy
fashion of his own, that was somewhat amusing
to the home critics.
</p>

<p>
Then he had schools for the children; and on
alternate Sunday afternoons Mr. Logan held
service in the school-room for those unable to
come over to Hepshaw Church.  More than this
was not possible at present; but, as he modestly
informed his auditor, that his sister and he had
done their best to organize a Sunday school, and
to hold weekly Bible-class for such as choose to
attend.
</p>

<p>
"Langley is great among the women," he
observed with a bright smile; "she half lives
at the cottages.  I wish I were half as successful
with my boys."
</p>

<p>
Queenie had yet to learn the value that Garth
Clayton set on his boys, and how the best and
highest part of his life was lived among them.
</p>

<p>
It was too dark to go down the village, as
Queenie found they all called it; so Langley
proposed they should go in by-and-bye and have
some music.  All the Claytons were musical
except Garth, though Garth would have been
the last to own his deficiency in this respect, and
always held his own manfully in the family
concerts, in spite of Cathy's sometimes insisting
on stopping her ears with cotton-wool, and Ted's
muttered observation, that he never knew that
rooks cawed so loudly at night.
</p>

<p>
But Garth, generally so sensitive to criticism,
cared nothing for these home witticisms.  He
loved to air his lungs freely.  He would burst into
'Simon the Cellarer,' or 'the Vicar of Bray,' or,
better still, the often-abused 'Village Blacksmith,'
with an honest disregard of all soft inflexion or
minor chords that was painfully ludicrous.  Ted
and Cathy would throw themselves back in their
chair and laugh noiselessly while the performance
went on, and even Langley would bite her
lip as her thin flexible fingers moved over the
keys, the sounds she evoked almost swallowed
up in that mighty bass.
</p>

<p>
I think, after all, though they laughed they
loved to hear it, and would better have spared
many a sweeter and choicer thing out of their
home daily life.  Garth never used half-measures.
As Cathy once drily said, "He does everything
thoroughly, even to making a noise, or singing,
my dear,&mdash;I believe he calls it by that name."
</p>

<p>
His laugh, too, was quite a surprise to
Queenie when she heard it first; true, it was
rather boyishly loud, but its delicious abandon
of mirth was thoroughly infectious; none but
Langley could ever hear it without joining in it.
He would throw his head back, tossing back the
wave of dark hair as he did so, and the strong,
even, white teeth would shine under the
moustache; while the pealing ha-ha would provoke
corresponding mirth.
</p>

<p>
"It does one good to hear Garth Clayton
laugh," Mr. Logan said once.  "Only a man with
a good conscience could laugh like that."
</p>

<p>
Queenie sat in her low basket-work chair,
watching the ins and outs of this happy home-circle,
too thoroughly interested and amused to
dream of fatigue, though they had excused her
singing that night on that score.
</p>

<p>
"I play very little; but I am supposed to sing
tolerably well, that is, most people like my voice,"
she had said, quite frankly, in answer to their
polite inquiries.
</p>

<p>
"She sings like an angel," was Cathy's verdict
on this; "her voice is as fresh and clear and
true as a lark's, but her fingers move over the
keys a little like drum-sticks.  I have often told
you so, Queen; you put all your expression in
your voice."
</p>

<p>
"I shall ask Miss Clayton to play my accompaniments,"
was Queenie's graceful answer.  She
was not a bit annoyed at her friend's plain speaking;
she liked to be told of her faults, and always
set herself earnestly to mend them.
</p>

<p>
She practised sedulously after this evening,
and gleaned all manner of hints from Langley.
</p>

<p>
"You must teach your fingers to speak; they
make acquaintance too stiffly with the keys,"
Langley said once to her.  "You play so correctly,
too; it is such a pity you do not make us feel
your music."
</p>

<p>
"My life has been all drudgery, you see,"
Queenie answered, humbly; "there has been so
little music in it, all the harmony got jarred out
of it somehow.  It has been only grinding at
hard tasks, rubbing out sums for little girls, and
putting them in again; one couldn't learn to play
tunes happily after that."
</p>

<p>
"But you sing, and so sweetly too."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, one learns that at church; singing is part
of one's religion," went on the girl reverently.
"Nothing, however sordid and hard, can keep
religion out of one's life; it is just there always.
Slaves sing, you know, and blind chaffinches, and
poor miners under-ground over their work.  It
keeps off bad thoughts.  Oh, every one must
sing," she finished with a smile, feeling that now
for the first time in her young toil-worn life she
was really resting on her oars.
</p>

<p>
Only resting for a brief space though; by-and-bye
she must take them up again, and row
on bravely, against the stream perhaps, through
marshes of sedgy weeds, fighting against a
sullen current, perhaps drifted into deeper
waters, but always with the broad blue sky
above her, with tints of silver-lined clouds and
possible sunshine, with hopes of safe harborage
by-and-bye.
</p>

<p>
"I help myself, and therefore God will help
me," Queenie had often said to herself in her
sorely-tried youth.  "I am afraid of nothing but
doing wrong, and seeing Emmie suffer; the rest
I can bear;" and this belief in herself saved
them both.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to take you to see all our celebrities,"
announced Cathy solemnly at the breakfast
table the next morning.  "It is Langley's
district day, and she will have nothing to say to
any of us until lunch time.  I propose that we
leave Emmie with Deborah to shell peas, while
we do Hepshaw thoroughly."
</p>

<p>
"You must take me into the church first,"
observed Queenie, quite prepared for a long
morning of delicious idleness, and in the true
holiday spirit, alert and ready for any chance
enjoyment.  "I think there is something
delightful in making acquaintance with a fresh
place; even seeing fresh faces and hearing
different voices gives me an odd indescribable
sort of pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"You poor prisoner, yes," returned her friend
sympathizingly, as they walked down the little
garden path at the side of the house, and passed
through the gate that opened on the churchyard,
with its long terrace planted picturesquely with
sycamores.  "You are like a nun; you have only
peeped at the world through a sort of invisible
grating in Miss Titheridge's front parlor.  You
must make up for lost time, and live every
moment thoroughly, as Garth and I do."
</p>

<p>
"That is just it; we don't half live our lives,
we girls," replied Queenie dreamily; "half of us
seem asleep; our faculties lie dormant, and get
rusted just for want of use.  Miss Titheridge
hung round my neck like a mill-stone; she
literally crushed and pulverized all the best parts
of me.  It is being born again; it is a sort of
moral regeneration, this feeling of freedom,
this&mdash;oh, how can I make you understand it all,
Cathy!"
</p>

<p>
"Seeing is believing," was the brusque answer.
"You are a different creature, my dear Madam
Dignity; you were like the frond of my
favorite prickly shield fern that I was watching
yesterday.  You were all there, you know, the
greenness and the freshness; but one could not
get at you, you were so tightly swathed and
coiled up."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," returned Queenie joyously; "and now
I have found myself, my own individuality.  I
do think, seriously, that I have a larger capacity
for living than other people.  I have good health,
that is one thing; my constitution is perfect;
then I love work, I really and literally do, Cathy.
Work braces one, it brings all one's faculties
into play; work is rest; inaction, idleness;
pleasure for the sake of pleasure, is simply
paralysis of one's higher life, it is premature old
age."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I felt as you do," was the half-envious
answer; "there is nothing little about you,
Queenie, Garth said so last night."
</p>

<p>
"Did he? you should not have told me that, Cath."
</p>

<p>
"Why not pray.  I just asked him how he
liked you; I wanted to get at his opinion, you
see, and he answered, just as gravely as though
he were mentor, that he thought I had chosen
my friend wisely, that you seemed a thoroughly
healthy-minded girl."
</p>

<p>
"I think we will go into the church now,"
interrupted Queenie, somewhat irrelevantly.  There
was a little flush of pleasure in her cheek.  She
was glad he had said that; it was just the sort
of praise she most coveted.  She wanted Cathy's
people to think well of her; if the truth must be
known, she hungered for their appreciation as a
half-starved child might have done.  Crumbs
would not satisfy her; condescension or kindness
would not feed her thoroughly; she must have
their full commendation, their equal friendship.
She had known them so long, she had seen
them all so perfectly with her inner vision,
that she could not feel as a stranger amongst
them.
</p>

<p>
"I am so at home with them already," she
had said to her friend the previous night.  "There
are no hard beginnings; we are friends to start
with; there is no thawing, because there is no ice,"
she had said, with a certain vague enthusiasm,
which, nevertheless, had been perfectly understood
by Cathy.  "One has so much hard up-hill work
with most people," she had continued, talking out
her thoughts half to herself.  "Don't you know
exactly how common-place people make acquaintance,
how laboriously they try to find out one's
tastes!  They do it about as gracefully as though
they were breaking stones on the highway, or
hammering flints as boys do to elicit sparks, and
all the time looking as though they knew you
had nothing in you worth coming to light.  Oh,
it is terribly fatiguing.  I once heard a very
clever man liken modern society to the
mummy-room of the British Museum.  He said, 'Human
beings were so swathed and bound up in
conventionality that there was no getting at the real
thing at all.'"
</p>

<p>
"I like Langley's way of knowing people,"
Cathy had answered; "she just knows them at
once, takes it for granted, I mean, that all that
interests her interests them.  We had such an
argument about it one day, when I would have
it that she had bored some one about the soup-kitchen.
'I was so full of it myself that I knew
that I should not talk so well on any other
subject,' was her sole apology.  And then she
told me I was quite wrong, 'that people, after all,
liked to be treated as reasonable beings, and not
like children pleased with sugar-plums.  "Give,
and it shall be given you," was just as true in
social intercourse as it was in the sense first
intended.  If you sow tares you will reap tares,
child; always remember that,' she had finished.
I prefer scattering precious grain.  You have no
idea how often one reaps a rich harvest.  It is
the real thing, you see, and people like that."
</p>

<p>
Queenie and Cathy were largely given to
conversations such as these.  It was just talking out
their thoughts, as they called it.  They aired all
manner of quaint subjects in this way, these two
honest-hearted girls.  Both were a little vague at
times; most women are.  Cathy always amused
her friend mightily.  She had a habit at certain
times, in her "goody moods," as she termed
them, of taking herself to pieces to examine
her moral mechanism, just as though she were
examining the works of a new watch, as Queenie
would tell her, clogging the wheels and stopping
progress all the time.  "If you are always taking
yourself up by the roots to see how you grow
you won't grow at all," she assured her in her
droll way.  "You ought not always to be looking
at your defects and blemishes in the glass.
People freckle from the sun sometimes; but I
don't believe over-much sunshine hurts any one.
Keep tight hold of the reins, never let go, and
then try and forget everything but the road you
are travelling.  Forget nothing but yourself;
mamma always said that."
</p>

<p>
There was something very fresh and sweet in
this girlish intercourse, devoid as it was of
vanity and selfishness; they were tolerably equal
in capacity; neither could teach the other much,
but they could learn together.  It was as though
they were two young gleaners following the
reapers: now one gathered a stray sheaf and
tossed it into the lap of the other; everything&mdash;an
idea, a thought&mdash;was just a golden ear to be
winnowed into grain.  At times their content
would have filled a granary.
</p>

<p>
Happy season of youth! when everything is
delightful because everything is new; when
harvests are more bountiful; when the mildew and
the blight and the canker-worm are unknown;
when the sky and earth meet and touch softly;
when beautiful thoughts steal like strange birds
in the twilight; when the glimmer of a star will
provoke a reverie; when a hand-clasp will wake
a world of dreams; when the whole universe is
not too big a setting for one small beating heart;
when one believes in one's guardian angel, and
heaven is so near&mdash;so near.
</p>

<p>
It is not always so.  Alas! alas! for the
anointed eyes purged from their youthful blindness,
made wise with the serpent-knowledge of evil and
good.  Tread softly here, ye worldlings, with lifted
sandals and bated breath; for here, as in all real
lovely things fresh from the Maker's hand, is
indeed holy ground.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was moderate in her praises of Hepshaw
church; nevertheless, it pleased her with a
certain sense of fitness.  There was no beauty of
architecture, no tastefulness of detail; it was just
a village church, adapted to the needs of a rustic
population.
</p>

<p>
But there was something grateful in its
simplicity.  Through the open door the fresh sweet
winds blew straight from heaven; the shadows
of the sycamores swept without the porch; some
leaves rustled on the threshold.  Queenie walked
down the narrow aisle, turning over the well-worn
books on the desks.  A smile crossed her
face when she saw the font; the mean little stone
stoup struck her as incongruous.  "It seems a
pity to see that," she said very simply, "I can
almost cover it with the palm of my hand; it
ought to be so wide and massive, filled to the
brim with purifying and regenerating water,
lavishly given and lavishly bestowed, not doled
in drops."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! here comes Mr. Miles," answered
Cathy; "he is the boys' schoolmaster.  We have
no schoolmistress, you know; the old one is
married and is going away with her husband.
He has come to practise on the organ; he is
organist, choirmaster, and I don't know what
besides."
</p>

<p>
"Is he nice?" whispered Queenie.  She just
caught sight of the pale, serious-looking young
man, dressed in shabby black like a Methodist
parson of the old school, who came limping up
the aisle on one crutch.
</p>

<p>
"Hum! truth lies sometimes at the bottom of
a deep well," was Cathy's ambiguous reply.
"Yes, Garth says he is nice; he pities him.
Somehow I can't make him out; I don't know
why, but I always think of Eugene Aram, or the
school-master in the 'Mutual Friend,' when I see
him.  I am sure he has got a history.  I don't
like a young man with a history; from a child I
never could bear riddles.  Ted is quite fond of
him, though.  I believe half my dislike comes
from his persisting in dressing like a broken-down
undertaker; he only wants a white tie to make
him complete."  They were happily in the lane
by this time, and Queenie could enjoy her laugh
without scruple of conscience.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the vicarage, Cathy? but of course it
is; I knew it from your description.  You are a
perfect word-painter; all your portraits are true
to life."
</p>

<p>
"That means caricature."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose so; but, all the same, your
likenesses are thoroughly spirited."
</p>

<p>
"Only I never miss out the moles and the
freckles.  This is not the ideal vicarage, is it, <i>ma
chère?</i> though I could show you one not many
miles from here.  Crossgill Vicarage is lovely; I
must take you to see it some day, as nurse used
to say; it is the dearest, most picturesque place.
A little river flows through the village just in the
middle of the road; and the church is beautiful;
and the vicarage a quaint old house with gable
ends embosomed in creepers, with the loveliest
garden always blazing with flowers."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds nice."
</p>

<p>
"When we drive over there we have tea in
the hall; it is wainscoted with oak, and there is
a lattice window, and an old oak staircase and
gallery, all tiny, but so quaint, and the old nurse,
nearly eighty, waits upon us; I do love the
place so."
</p>

<p>
"This is bare prose after that," returned
Queenie, as they walked up the steep narrow
garden, between rows of cabbages and bushes of
pale pink and white roses.  All sorts of homely
old-fashioned flowers bloomed amongst the beans
and peas and other vegetables, red and orange
nasturtiums, tall spikes of lavender, blue
larkspur, and masses of sweet mignonette.  "No,
not all bare prose," correcting herself and
pointing to a bed of pansies, looking in the sunshine
like a cluster of gold and violet butterflies poised
on motionless velvet wings; "there is a bit of
floral painting for you; there is a whole allegory
in that."
</p>

<p>
"An allegory! why, Queenie, you are actually
becoming poetical.  If Mr. Logan were here he
would tell us that that is a species of
violet&mdash;<i>Viola tricolor</i>&mdash;called also pansy."
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, there is a higher meaning in
that still, butterfly life.  Look at this one with
glorious violet wings and just one golden eye;
does it not look as though it ought to fly instead
of remaining so humbly on its green stalk?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my 'Queen of Sheba,'" half impatiently
and half amused, "what do you make of that?
I am not a Solomon, to answer all your hard
questions."
</p>

<p>
"I think," returned Queenie, hesitating, "that
it means to teach us that the true heart's-ease
remains content in its own place; it has wings,
but they are not ready for flight, they just carry
the dew and the sunshine, that is all.  Brave
little golden hearts, always radiant and smiling,"
she continued, lightly brushing the bloom with
her finger tip.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Logan!" ejaculated Cathy, elevating her
eyebrows in a sort of comic despair, "will you
suggest some appropriate answer in return for
this poetical dissertation," and Queenie, blushing
hotly, dropped the flowers and turned round.
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lady, I am afraid I startled
you," said Mr. Logan benevolently; "but I did
not like to play the eavesdropper any longer,
though Miss Catherine was mischievous enough
to try and keep me in the background.  As it is,
I have stolen a very pretty fancy, which I know
will delight Charlotte."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott, Mr. Logan," returned Cathy,
with much solemnity.  "I know what a stickler
you are for conventionalities and etiquette,
Mr. Logan, and I could not suffer you to utter
another sentence without due introduction."
</p>

<p>
"Is not that a slight deviation from the truth,
my dear Miss Catherine, when you know, at least
every one must know, my little failings in that
respect? still I was not aware of your friend's
name, and I dare say she was equally ignorant of
mine."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," returned Queenie, trying to
maintain her gravity.  Cathy's eyes were dancing
with fun, like a mischievous kitten; the wicked
little creature knew how difficult it was for her
friend not to laugh outright.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan certainly presented a curious
appearance to a stranger's eyes.  The good man was
clad in a brown dressing-gown, patched neatly at
the elbows with parti-coloured cloth, and his
spectacles were pushed up his forehead, showing
a pair of near-sighted blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall spare man, with the plainest
face, Queenie thought, she had ever seen, the
features were so rugged and irregular; the
spectacles and grey hair gave him an elderly
appearance.  Queenie heard afterwards that he
was only in his fortieth year, and that Miss Cosie
was quite ten years older.
</p>

<p>
The eyes were the only redeeming features.
Either seen with or without the spectacles they
were mild and yet keen; they could beam softly,
as they did now at the two girls, with hearty
benevolence, or dart searching glances that
seemed to quiver like an arrow-point in the
recesses of one's conscience.  "They look through
and through you," Cathy said once; "it is just
like throwing a torch into a dark place, it brings
all sorts of hidden things to light,&mdash;cobwebs and
little foolishnesses, and odds and ends of rubbish."
</p>

<p>
"I like eyes that talk," was Queenie's answer
to this.  She liked Mr. Logan's face, in spite of
its plainness; his voice too was so pleasant.  She
conceived a warm respect for the Vicar of
Hepshaw on this first visit.  In spite of his
somewhat worn and homely appearance, the innate
dignity of the man made itself felt as he walked
beside them in his old threadbare garment.
</p>

<p>
"Charlotte; where are you, Charlotte?" he
exclaimed, raising his voice as they stood in
what was termed the best sitting-room, a
somewhat humble apartment with one small window.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Christopher, my dear," responded a
small chirping voice from the inner recesses
of the house, and a tiny woman tripped softly
after it.
</p>

<p>
Miss Cosie! who could help giving her the
name, she was so small and so compact, with
such a comfortable pincushion-like compactness;
a little grey mouse of a woman, with, her grey
dress, and grey Shetland shawl crossed over her
shoulders, and the two large glossy curls pinned
up on either side of the small head, which she
was always patting with her little fat hands.
</p>

<p>
Why her very voice had a cosy sound in it.
"My dear" seemed to drop perpetually out of it;
it was a caressing, petting sort of voice, with a
continual hush in it.  "Hush! there, there, my
dear," was her panacea for every one, from a
crying child to a widowed virago.  "There, there,
my dear, we can't have him back, but I dare say
he is better off," or "there, there, my good man,
go home to your poor wife," to a six-foot piece of
drunken ruffianism she met staggering through
the village and vociferating oaths in the darkness.
"There, there, poor thing, he has lost himself,
and is just daft; hush! we won't listen; the
devil is schoolmaster to-night, and is teaching
him a little bit of his own language."
</p>

<p>
Cosie! why the name was an inspiration; it
fitted her to a nicety.  Charlotte was simply a
badinage, something for which her godmother
was to blame, not she; no one but her brother
would ever call her by such a term; it was almost
crushing&mdash;but Miss Cosie!
</p>

<p>
Queenie called her by it at once, after the
little woman had tripped up to her and lightly
kissed her on the cheek, and then patted her
with her white dimpled hand.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, my dear, I knew we should be
friends; take off your bonnet and stay, and you
shall taste my ginger wine."
</p>

<p>
This was always Miss Cosie's first speech to
strangers.  It was true no one ever wore bonnets
in Hepshaw; but it was one of her ways to
lament their disuse among the younger generation,
as a falling-off of the good old times.
</p>

<p>
"Such fly-away, foolish things, my dear; now,"
as she would say, "a bonnet is so much more
comfortable and becoming, and a pretty face
looks so well in it.  Shady! nonsense, my love,
you can always wear an ugly if you are afraid of
your complexion; but bonnets were bonnets in
those days, one did not carry a nosegay tied up
in straw then."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cosie's one idea in life, next to petting
people, was her brother.  No one, in her opinion,
could come up to him; he was simply perfect.
</p>

<p>
"Such a mind, such a genius, and yet as
simple as a child," she would exclaim.  Her love
and pride in him fairly bubbled over at times.
Christopher, or Kit, as she sometimes called him,
was the object of her sisterly idolatry.  It was odd
and yet touching to see her protecting tenderness;
perhaps her ten years' seniority had given
the motherly element to her affections.  "You see,
Kit is still a boy to me," she would say sometimes;
"when he was a little fellow I used to
put him to bed and sing him to sleep.  I never
can forget that somehow; and, dear me, my dear,
he is still so helpless,&mdash;these clever men are, you
know,&mdash;he never can remember even to put on a
warm flannel or take a clean handkerchief out
of his drawer; I just have to go in and put
everything ready to his hand."
</p>

<p>
"Why, when the bishop came once," continued
Miss Cosie, lifting her hands and eyes, "he was
actually going to the station in that brown
dressing-gown of his, if I had not run down the
lane after him.  Think what his lordship would
have said at seeing one of his clergy dressed out
in that ragged-robin fashion!"
</p>

<p>
"I have found out what flower Miss Cosie
most resembles," said Queenie, when, after an
hour's chat, they had left the vicarage.  "Guess,
Cathy."
</p>

<p>
"Little eyebright, I should say, or the ox-eyed
daisy."
</p>

<p>
"No; the pansy of course.  Cathy, how can
you be so dense! why she looks and talks and
breathes of nothing but heart's-ease."
</p>

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
A VISIT TO ELDERBERRY LODGE.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, ay, forsooth,<br>
  They bring their own love with them when they come,<br>
  But if they come not there is peace and rest;<br>
  The pretty lambs! and yet she cries for more:<br>
  Why, the world's full of them, and so is heaven&mdash;<br>
  They are not rare."&mdash;<i>Jean Ingelow.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The girls had lingered so long at the vicarage
that Cathy postponed their intended walk until
after luncheon; but as soon as it was over they
sallied forth again, this time with Emmie.
</p>

<p>
They went through the length and breadth of
the village, peeped into the schools, visited one
or two of the cottages, crossing Langley more
than once on their path; and Queenie was again
struck with the bright cheerfulness and cleanliness
of the whole place.  She took an especial
fancy to the post-office&mdash;a pretty rustic-looking
cottage, with a long garden full of sweet
old-fashioned flowers.
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, I have fallen in love with this place,"
she said at last.  "I think life would go on
peacefully and well here; look, Emmie, at this
empty cottage; is not this just the one you
always wanted to live in with Caleb?"
</p>

<p>
They had just passed the turning that led to
Church-Stile House; beyond were a cluster of
new-built villas.  Emmie clapped her hands and
ran breathlessly across the road.
</p>

<p>
"It has a board up 'to let.'  Oh, Queen, do
let us go over it, just for fun; it is such a dear,
sweet little house; and what a long garden!&mdash;look."
</p>

<p>
"We can go in if you like," returned Cathy,
smiling at the child's eagerness.  "I know the
woman who takes care of it; it is rather a pretty
place, though ill-kept and desolate.  I heard
Garth say it would let for a mere song."
</p>

<p>
Queenie did not answer; a strange thought had
been agitating her all the morning, a possibility
and a probability that had taken tremendous
hold of her mind.  An odd feeling came over her
as she followed Cathy through the little gate&mdash;one
of those weird over-shadowings or pre-visions
that baffle metaphysicians.  The place somehow
seemed familiar to her; had she seen it in a
dream?  A dim sense that it belonged to her,
that she had trodden that path before, and
peeped through the lattice windows, oppressed
her with a giddy unreality.  Had she conjured
it up among the shadows of the old garret? or
had she seen a place so nearly approximate that
its similarity deceived her?  She gave Emmie's
hand an involuntary squeeze as they stood in
the little porch.
</p>

<p>
It was certainly a pretty place, in spite of the
air of neglect and disuse that pervaded
everything.  A long narrow lawn in front ran down
to the road; opposite was the smart grocer's
shop, and the lane that led to the church and
vicarage.
</p>

<p>
Some laburnums and lilacs grew near the
house; there was a little border for flowers
under the windows: only a ragged-looking
Sweet-William and some weeds grew there now.
Behind, an ill-kept lawn sloped down to the
house, running on to the back door, giving it a
waste, barren look, and imparting an air of
dampness to the whole place.
</p>

<p>
The inside was a little less dreary: the low
lattice window, odd-shaped and diamond-paned,
gave a picturesque finish to the rooms; the
little square hall was pleasant.  There were two
sitting-rooms, one much smaller than the other,
with a front view that was sufficiently cheerful;
and a large bare-looking apartment, with two
windows looking out on the steep green waste
behind.  Nettles and docks and festoons of
coarse-looking ivy climbed about the window
ledges.  The kitchen was small and dull.  Upstairs,
three rooms in different stages of dampness
opened out on the dark landing.  Some of the
paper was torn off, and hung in moist curling
lengths.  A scurry and patter of tiny feet sounded
beside them; they were evidently tenanted by
families of mice.
</p>

<p>
"It is a miserable place after all," observed
Cathy.  "Take care, one of those boards are
rotten, Emmie; my foot nearly went through
just now."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," returned Queenie, hesitatingly,
"I think I have taken a fancy to it; it might
be made very pretty with fresh papers and a
little paint.  To whom does it belong?"
</p>

<p>
"To Captain Fawcett.  We are going there
directly; Langley has given me a message for
Mrs. Fawcett.  Oh! do come to the window a
moment, Queen; there is Mrs. Morris stopping
at the corner to speak to the three Miss Palmers.
Look at the dear old creatures, dressed just alike.
There you have all the aristocracy of Hepshaw,
with the exception of Church-Stile House and
the vicarage people."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that constitutes your society?"
inquired Queenie, pressing closer to the dirty
panes, and trying to inspect critically the flock
of womanhood gathered round Greyson's smart
window.
</p>

<p>
"What would you ask more?" returned her
companion drily; "we don't have balls and
concerts in Hepshaw.  To dine with the Fawcetts
and drink tea with Mrs. Morris and the Miss
Palmers are our sole dissipation.  Ted finds so
much tea a little intoxicating, and prefers
sometimes staying at home; but Langley and Garth
always do their duty manfully."
</p>

<p>
"I like the look of Mrs. Morris, she is tall and
graceful-looking; but I cannot see her face under
that brown mushroom.  Is she nice, Cath?"
</p>

<p>
"Hum! there are widows and widows.  She is
not the 'widow indeed' St. Paul talks about;
but I won't tell tales.  She has a pretty home,
and seven little hopes, more or less red-haired,
like the deceased and ever-lamented Major
Morris&mdash;the dear Edmund to whose loss she owes
her present blighted and remarkably healthy
existence."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, how can you take off people so!  I
tell you I like the look of her."
</p>

<p>
"So do I.  She has white teeth and bright
eyes, which she knows how to use.  Do you see
the direction they are taking now? 'why tarry the
wheels of his chariot!'  Isn't that our
waggonette coming up from Warstdale?  Never mind my
nonsense, Queenie; we must talk gossip sometimes
in this dreary place.  Mrs. Morris is very
good-natured and very clever, and the seven little hopes
are clean, wholesome children."
</p>

<p>
"Look! your brother is stopping to speak to
them."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; as though he would pass the
Palmers!  You have no idea how fond the dear old
ladies are of him.  They pet him, and knit
endless mittens and comforters for him; he has a
drawer full, I believe.  Look at them now, wagging
their old heads and fluttering round him like
a flock of grey pigeons; that is Miss Faith, his
favorite, near him now."
</p>

<p>
"Faith; what a curious name!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they are all a cardinal virtue; they must
have had devout parents.  The eldest is Hope,
then comes Prudence and Charity, and lastly,
Faith.  Faith is much the nicest and the
prettiest; she is comparatively young too."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to go and see them."
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall, but not this afternoon; we
shall only have time for the Fawcetts.  Their
house is full of curious odds and ends, and though
they dress alike they have separate rooms, which
they have furnished after their own taste.  I must
coax them to let you see them; it will give you
an insight into their characters."
</p>

<p>
"And they have none of them married,"
exclaimed Queenie, with a girl's involuntary pity
for the monotonous existence of single blessedness.
</p>

<p>
"How could they!" returned Cathy, with a
puzzled elevation of her eyebrows.  "They have
lived in Hepshaw all their lives; they could not
have possibly seen any gentleman except the
Vicar, and I dare say he was married.  You
would not have a clergyman's daughter commit
the unpardonable crime of entering into a
<i>mésalliance</i> with the inn-keeper or the chemist!"
continued Cathy, drawing down her lips at the
corner, and speaking in a "prunes-and-prism"
voice.  "That is Miss Hope; and so the poor
cardinal virtues have wasted all their sweetness
on the desert air."
</p>

<p>
"How very sad," began Queenie; but Cathy
suddenly cut her short.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," was the somewhat stormy
rejoinder; "people are just as well without
marrying.  For my part, I think men are a
mistake.  I am sick to death of school-girl rubbish;
half the girls at Miss Titheridge's pretended
to be in love, and with such creatures too! any
masculine face approaching to the ideal of a
barber's block was pronounced handsome, fascinating.
You know how you hated it all, Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"As I hate all sham."
</p>

<p>
"Faugh! the thought of all the three-volume
trash I swallowed gives me moral dyspepsia even
now.  I recollect it was the fashion one term to
have a <i>cœur serré</i>; every one had an experience or
a disappointment.  I know half the school was in
love with Garth.  Well, we have flattened our
faces long enough against this bottle-green glass;
now we must go on to Elderberry Lodge."
</p>

<p>
"Is that Captain Fawcett's?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Mrs. Morris's, next door, is the Sycamores,
and the Miss Palmers' is the Evergreens.
Now I have talked myself hoarse for your benefit;
it is your ladyship's turn now.  There is the
Captain himself working in his front garden; is
he not a fine-looking man, Queenie?"
</p>

<p>
Queenie acquiesced, as the tall soldierly figure
walked down to the gate to greet them.  She
liked the brown weather-beaten face, with its
grizzled moustache and closely-cropped head,
looking as though it were covered with grey
bristles.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, ladies.  I saw Miss Clayton
just now, and she told me you were coming.  Fine
weather for the crops; I was just pottering
among my geraniums.  Sit down, both of you,
while I go into the house and find my little
woman; she's palavering with the maids somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't hurry her, Captain Fawcett; we
shall be very comfortable out here under this
awning.  Isn't this a delicious little garden? look
at those roses and bee-hives.  Bless you, the
Captain's garden is his hobby; he spends the
greater part of his time working here, and in his
kitchen-garden.  He has the greatest show of
flowers for miles round."
</p>

<p>
"Have they no children?"
</p>

<p>
"They had one, a girl, but she died.  I almost
wish we had not brought Emmie; I think Alice
was just twelve when she caught the fever.  It is
eight or nine years ago, but they have never got
over it.  Ah, there comes the Captain with his
'little woman.'"
</p>

<p>
Queenie stifled an exclamation as she rose
from her seat.  Mrs. Fawcett was as tall as
her husband,&mdash;a thin, long-necked woman, fully
six feet high, and gaunt almost to scragginess.
</p>

<p>
She had a worn, anxious-looking face; it was
difficult to imagine it had ever been young or
good-looking.  The prominent teeth, high cheekbones,
and scanty grey hair, told no tale of past
beauty.  It was a plain face, grown plainer
with age.  She looked like a caricature of her
husband's taste beside his handsome old face
and grand figure.
</p>

<p>
Her hand-shake was almost masculine in its
grasp, and her voice was harsh, but not ungentle;
but both face and voice softened strangely at the
first sight of Emmie.  The husband and wife
exchanged looks.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, missus, I see."
</p>

<p>
"Is this your little sister, Miss Marriott?
Come to me, darling; how old are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Twelve," repeated Emmie, looking up in
her face with solemn blue eyes.  Emmie rarely
smiled with strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve; do you hear that, Joshua?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, I hear it, little woman."
</p>

<p>
"Just her age," repeated the wife hurriedly,
laying her hand on his arm, while her eyes filled
with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve years and three months," he repeated
involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"And she has Alice's blue eyes too,&mdash;your
own color, Captain."
</p>

<p>
The girls had listened with silent sympathy to
this brief interchange of sorrowful questioning;
but now Emmie interrupted them.  She drew
closer to Mrs. Fawcett, and laid a hand
confidingly on her lap.
</p>

<p>
"Was Alice the name of your little girl?
Cathy said you had one."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Emmie; come here to me, love;" but
Emmie hung back from her friend's extended
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; her name was Alice; she is still my
little girl," returned the poor mother, speaking
with her pure maternal faith, and unconsciously
verifying the eternity of love; "the treasure once
given never really lost, only lent to safe keeping."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she is your little girl," was Emmie's
answer.  "You mean to see her again some day,
only she is not keeping house with you now;
perhaps she would have got tired.  God would
know all about that; He does not like children to
be tired; He was very nearly taking me away for
the same reason, only I got rested somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Captain, do you hear that?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, poor bairn; too big a mind for so small
a body."
</p>

<p>
"Am I like her?" persisted Emmie curiously,
looking up into the plain face, now softened
into motherly comeliness, the beautifier, love,
smoothing out irregularities and roughnesses
even on Mrs. Fawcett's unloving visage.
</p>

<p>
Queenie heard afterwards that she had never
been handsome even in her youth, but that she
had been loved, as some plain women are by
men, with a constancy and devotion which
many a spoiled beauty fails to win.  "He must
have seen the real goodness shining behind her
plainness," Cathy said afterwards, when Queenie
and she talked the matter over.
</p>

<p>
"Are you like her, darling?" answered Mrs. Fawcett,
mournfully.  "You have her large blue
eyes; but, until she fell ill, she had rosy cheeks
and long dark curls.  She was the very image of
her father, the dear angel."
</p>

<p>
"My hair has been cut off," returned Emmie,
pointing to the soft little rings just peeping
under her cap; "it means to curl too some day.
I have always longed for curls; so the angels
always have them in pictures."
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, my little maid, and look at
my roses," interrupted the Captain, reading his
wife's troubled countenance aright.  The tears
streamed over the thin face as Emmie trotted
happily away with him.
</p>

<p>
"That is just the way they walked hand in
hand every morning to look at the roses," sobbed
the poor mother.  "'Father's roses' were the last
words Alice ever said; 'I should like one of
father's roses'; and when he went out to pick her
one she put her head down on my shoulder and
then she was gone."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's long eye-lashes glittered with
sympathizing tears.  She could enter into all; she had
so nearly lost Emmie.  She thought of the father
going down to his garden to pick red and white
roses for the little dead hand that could not open
to receive them.  "My beloved is gone down
into his garden to the beds of spices, to feed in
the gardens, and to gather lilies": those beautiful
words of the Canticles came into her mind.  What
if in Paradise, while parents wept below for them
that are not, the children they had lost went in
bright bands after One who died for them, "when
He went down into His garden to gather lilies!"
</p>

<p>
The girls were rather subdued when they bade
good-bye to the good Captain and his wife, and
turned into the little lane.  Cathy pushed her
hat restlessly from her forehead; some thought or
discontent wrinkled it.
</p>

<p>
"What lots of good people there are in the
world after all," she half grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"There are two there," returned her friend, with
a gesture of her hands towards Elderberry Lodge.
"My visit there has made me sad, and yet it has
done me good.  I am so glad we went, Cathy."
</p>

<p>
"Good people seem to agree with you; they
never make you discontented, as they do me."
</p>

<p>
"No; I like standing on tiptoe till my neck
aches.  I love size, bigness, grand moral structure;
it does one good to breathe the same air with some
people; it is like resting on a hill-top and
enjoying a wide beautiful view.  I don't mind at all
being a pigmy among giants.  If I had been
Gulliver I should have had small sympathy with
the Lilliputians.  Littleness of mind is abhorrent
to me."
</p>

<p>
"There you go," grumbled Cathy; "you
sensible people are enough to drive one crazy.
Over-much goodness makes me vixenish; I feel
inclined to fly in the face of it."
</p>

<p>
"You foolish child."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Logan is often too much for me, and so is
Miss Cosie; I run away from them both sometimes.
I'll own, if you like, the disease is
infectious to those predisposed to it.  If you stay
long enough in their vicinity you might catch it,
you know.  Prevention is better than cure; so,
for fear I get too good, I just run away," finished
Cathy in her droll manner.
</p>

<p>
In the front court they came upon Garth digging
up a little flower-border under the hall window.
He threw down his spade when he saw them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've settled about the picnic in the
granite quarry.  We go to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Garth, you are a brick; I mean a dear old
fellow.  Oh," folding her hands pathetically,
"don't tell of me, the word only slipped out just
by accident.  Have you really arranged it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have had a talk with Langley.  She
says we must not lose the fine weather.  It is not
to be a grand affair, mind.  Only the Logans,
and Fawcetts, and Miss Faith; yes, and Harry
Chester."
</p>

<p>
"King Karl!  Oh, I am so glad.  Why, when
did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"He and Nanette are in there," pointing to
the drawing-room.  "Don't let me keep you if
you want to introduce him to Miss Marriott," as
Cathy looked eager and irresolute.  "He is a very
old friend of ours, and a great favorite with the
whole family," he continued, speaking to Queenie;
"in fact, Harry is a favorite with every one."
</p>

<p>
"Let her judge for herself," returned his sister,
impatiently.  "Come, Queenie, let us go in; I
have set my heart on being the first to introduce
you to the King of Karldale."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
IN THE GRANITE QUARRY.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "But still she found, or rather thought she found,<br>
  Her own worth wanting, others to abound;<br>
  Ascribed above their due to every one,<br>
  Unjust and scanty to herself alone."&mdash;<i>Dryden.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Queen, this is our old friend Mr. Chester,
commonly known in the district as the King of
Karldale; he plays Damon to Garth's Pythias,
and is a sort of useful Family Friend to us all."
</p>

<p>
Cathy's entrance as usual effected a sort of
whirlwind; her swift movements and flowing
draperies swept breezelike through the quiet
room.  Langley's low-toned "hush" was no
check on her volubility.  A look of amusement
crossed Mr. Chester's face as he stood up and
greeted the new-comers.
</p>

<p>
"Irrepressible as usual, Cathy," was his only
comment, as he reseated himself beside Langley,
and took up his little daughter, a solemn-faced
child of four, on his knee.
</p>

<p>
Queenie regarded the pair critically.  On the
whole the survey contented her.
</p>

<p>
The King of Karldale was a tall, powerfully-built
man, with a florid handsome face, half
hidden by a light curly beard, a countenance
marked more by good nature than intellect, but
bearing the stamp of plain honest common-sense.
</p>

<p>
Queenie wondered if it were her fancy, that a
vague uneasiness pervaded the man's gait at
times.  In spite of his cheerfulness and hearty
laugh there were hints of past or present
troubles in the worn lines round the kindly eyes;
even in the midst of their pleasant talk a
shadow now and then crossed his face, as though
some unwelcome remembrance obtruded itself.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, there was little or no
resemblance between the child and him.
</p>

<p>
Nan was evidently a character.
</p>

<p>
She sat perched on her father's knee in her
little white pelisse and sun-bonnet, with a large
woolly lamb in her arms, staring at Queenie
with great dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
Queenie noticed that now and then one small
hand would furtively touch her father's coat-sleeve,
and she would stroke the rough grey tweed
with a look of infinite contentment, but showed
no impatience or weariness during the long
discussion that followed the girls' entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Is my little mouse tired? is not Nan very
tired?" said Mr. Chester, at last stooping to peep
under the sun-bonnet.
</p>

<p>
Queenie caught the look, and then she said to
herself, "That little bright-eyed child is his idol."
</p>

<p>
"Nan is not so very tired, father," pronounced
the little creature with a slight lisp, and a stress
on the word, very; "a little, only a very little."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will go, my pet; say good-bye to
Langley," and Nan obediently slid down from her
father's knee, and trotted with sturdy
compactness across the room.
</p>

<p>
Queenie stood with the sisters in the porch
and watched them cross the tiny moat under
the dark sycamores, Nan wrapt up in a grey
rug, and seated comfortably in her little
chair-saddle on the back of an old white pony, her
white lamb still hugged in her arms, her
father holding the reins, and mounted on a
handsome brown mare.  "Nan has found her
voice now; do you hear how she is chattering to
him, Langley?" observed Cathy in an amused
voice.  "How those two dote on each other!  No
wonder Gertrude is jealous, the child cares
nothing for her mother; but then Gertrude is too
selfish to make a fuss over any one but herself."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my dear; what a terribly sweeping
assertion!  Gertrude is an undemonstrative
woman, one cannot tell how deeply she feels."
</p>

<p>
"And Harry is a demonstrative man, and
ought to have a wife who understands and
makes much of him, instead of one who frets
and teases him from morning to night.  It is no
good talking to me," continued Cathy, with a
burst of vindictiveness rather surprising from its
suddenness, "I detest that woman, with her
slim figure and dark eyes, and little would-be
elegancies.  She to be Harry's wife and the
mother of Nan!  Why I would not trust a pet
dog to her tender mercies and small tempers."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, all this is highly unnecessary,"
remonstrated her sister in a pained tone.  Her
face looked a little paler and sadder as she went
back into the house after uttering her little
protest.  A child's white woollen glove lay on the
carpet beside a stray sunbeam.  Queenie,
following her, saw as she stooped to pick it up that
she touched it lightly with her lips before laying
it aside in her work-basket.
</p>

<p>
The next day was warm and bright, "regular
Queen's weather," as Cathy chose to call it;
and at the time appointed a merry little party
assembled at the door of the Deer-hound, and
filled the two little waggonettes.
</p>

<p>
Garth had gone over to the Quarry, and left
his brother as his deputy, and a playful dispute
ensued between him and Captain Fawcett
concerning the selection of the occupants of each
waggonette.  "The difficulty of suiting folk was
truly awful," as Ted expressed it feelingly.
</p>

<p>
Captain Fawcett had secured Langley and
Miss Faith Palmer, and his wife and Miss
Cosie had tucked in Emmie between them, just
as Ted had slyly beckoned to the girls to
favor him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan and Mr. Chester had followed,
and Nan was carefully lifted in and placed beside
her father.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say that mite of a child is
going with us to the Quarry?" interposed
Mrs. Fawcett, in genuine dismay.  "What can her
mother be thinking about?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! her father takes her everywhere with
him," replied Langley softly; "she is out with
him all day on the farm; she is never tired.  I
know he has often carried her for miles, or walked
beside her pony."
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear! what a mistake," ejaculated Miss
Cosie, straightening her brown "ugly," in the
depths of which the gentle little mouse face was
almost buried from view, and trying to pat the
big curls.  "A child of that tender age ought to
be with her mother.  It reminds one of the child
in Kings&mdash;or was it in Samuel?&mdash;who got
sunstroke, or something of the kind, and cried, 'My
head, my head,' and they carried him to his
mother.  Think if something of that kind happened
to that dear child! her father would never
forgive himself; but there, there, he does it for
the best, poor dear."
</p>

<p>
"The child frets after him, and is never happy
away from him," replied Langley in a low voice,
for Mrs. Fawcett's eyes had filled with tears,
and she had taken Emmie's hand in hers.
"Mrs. Chester is a nervous invalid; and one
cannot judge in these cases," finished Langley in
a deprecating voice.
</p>

<p>
"True, my dear, true; but I am such an advocate
of mother's right, as I often tell Kit; there
is something so especially sacred in the claims of
maternity.  Bless you, I know all about their
feelings as much as if I had a dozen children,"
continued the little woman, brightly.  "Didn't I
have a dear old mother myself, and Kit her very
image, poor soul; and didn't she often say,
'Charlotte, my dear, you will know one day,
please God, what a mother's feelings are'!  And
so I do, my dear; and so does every woman,
married and single," finished Miss Cosie with a
little burst, "as long as there are young things
in the world needing our care."
</p>

<p>
"You are right," returned Langley in a stifled
voice; and just then the other waggonette passed,
Ted cracking his whip and gesticulating boyishly.
Nan was on her father's knee as usual, the little
white sun-bonnet rested on his shoulder, the
quiet dark eyes and rosy face full of a child's
contentment.
</p>

<p>
Garth received his guests at the entrance to
the works, and did the honors of the place with
great dignity.  "Is not the dear old fellow just in
his element," whispered Ted to Cathy, as they
stood behind the others.  Queenie caught the
whisper and smiled to herself.
</p>

<p>
"He looks just what he is, a ruler among
men; one who ought to be a leader, who expects
obedience as a right," she thought, as she
watched the tall athletic figure moving through
the sheds crowded with workmen.  "The old
grey coat and felt hat just suited him," she
thought.  Though he carried his head so high
he had a pleasant word or look for the men.
</p>

<p>
"My fellows are such splendid workmen," he
said once, with a little conscious pride in his
manner.  The words, "My men," "my boys,"
were perpetually on his lips.  Here, on his own
domain, among his subjects, he felt and moved
as a sort of king.  "Rival monarchs, my dear,"
observed Cathy mischievously&mdash;"King Karl and
the King of Warstdale."
</p>

<p>
To Queenie the whole scene was strangely
picturesque&mdash;the blue sky; the open sheds full
of noisy workers; the whirr of machinery; the
great blocks of rough-hewn granite, grey, fresh
from the quarries; then the smooth polished
slabs, shining with soft-mingled tints.  The
process, the amount of hard, patient labour,
astonished the girl.  She could have stood for a
long; time watching; the masons chiselling; and
fine-boring the hard stone.  Piles of grey and
pink granite lay in the centre, carved and shaped
into headstones.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan inspected them thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"White marble is more beautiful, especially
for the graves of women and children," she heard
him say to Captain Fawcett; "but then granite
is more impervious to weather.  In cemeteries,
for instance, where there are trees the constant
dropping and damp stains and defaces the beauty
of the marble; but nothing spoils the granite."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, to my mind, beats Warstdale
granite," replied the Captain meditatively.
"Marble is too white and chilly for our English
cemeteries; we want Italian sun to light it up.
Look at these warm tints; here is coloring,
durability, everything we want.  Can anything
be finer than this polish?"
</p>

<p>
Queenie was listening to them with interest
when Garth came up and claimed her attention.
</p>

<p>
"While they are getting the quarry engine
ready I want to show you the workmen's
cottages, and the room where Langley and I have
our classes," said the young man a little
condescendingly.  He looked grey-eyed, eager, rather
flushed with playing the part of host and cicerone
to so many ladies.  His white teeth gleamed
with a bright happy smile under his dark
moustache: but for all that his tone had a slight
accent of condescension that made Queenie smile
as she followed him.
</p>

<p>
"You are master here&mdash;Garth Clayton of
Warstdale&mdash;and I am a poor little school-teacher,
a nobody," thought the girl, with just a faint
touch of rebellion, growing hot all at once.
</p>

<p>
"Stay, this is rough walking; let me give
you some help," and he turned back and held out
his hand.  For a moment Queenie hesitated; it
was her nature to be independent, and walk
alone.  She never willingly owned to any small
feminine weakness.  "If she fell she could pick
herself up," she always said; but a glance at the
kind bright face changed her resolution.  She
took the offered hand without any demur, and
let herself be guided through the intricacies of
the path as meekly as Nan, who followed them,
holding tightly to her father's sleeve.  She stood
quietly beside him, an appreciative and most
sympathizing listener, as he explained, with not
unpardonable egotism, all his little schemes and
plans for the comfort of his workmen.  "My boys
deserve all that I can do for them, they are such
good fellows, and clever, too, some of them.
Why, there is Daniel Armstrong;" and here
followed a string of anecdotes bearing on the
cleverness of this man, the gratitude and good
feeling of another, the sad troubles of a third,
until Ted came down on them in a whirlwind of
indignation, to know what Garth meant by
keeping them all waiting?
</p>

<p>
"All right, Ted; go on with Miss Marriott,"
returned his brother good-humoredly, breaking
in upon the lad's wrath.  "I am going to carry
Nan;" and, as the little lady looked dubious,
and clung close to her father, he caught her up
and seated her lightly on his shoulder and
marched off with her, a smile breaking over
Nan's face as her father clapped his hands after
her.
</p>

<p>
The little engine was already waiting for them;
and the trucks were furnished with boxes and
hampers, which formed seats for the ladies.  Emmie
crept up to her sister to whisper her ecstasies.
"She had never been so happy in her life; everyone
was so good to her, that kind Mrs. Fawcett
especially; and Miss Cosie and Miss Faith
Palmer; she was sure she would love Miss Faith
dearly; and did not Queenie think she was very
pretty?"
</p>

<p>
"She certainly had been," Queenie thought,
"though no longer young."  It was a very sweet,
loveable face still, though with a certain sadness
of repression on it&mdash;the shadowing of an
over-quiet life.  Coloring would still have lent it
beauty; but, as it was, the pallid neutral tints
harmonized with the grey Quaker-like costume
and little close bonnet.  The voice was very
sweet, but lacked enthusiasm; it touched one like
some plaintive minor chord; it was the face and
voice that one meets behind the gratings of
nunneries, or in the hushed wards of a hospital,
where youth finds no place, and the bustle of life
is shut out.
</p>

<p>
She placed herself by Queenie as the engine
steamed off, somewhat slowly, and the work-sheds
receded from their view.
</p>

<p>
"You must come and see my sisters.  One of
them, Charity, is an invalid, and the sight of a
fresh face is such a treat to her.  Her world is
bounded by four walls, and she lives in her
books.  She knows far more about it than I do,
who was never a reader," said the quiet woman
with a little sigh.
</p>

<p>
Queenie fell in love with Miss Faith on the
spot, as she told Cathy afterwards.  Young as
she was, she knew far more of the world than
this woman of thirty-five.  The unsophisticated
freshness of the simple woman, her tender voice,
her old-fashioned ways, and little quaint
pedanteries, charmed the young governess, grown bitter
with the hard edge of life.  Before the day was
out she learnt a good deal about "the
Sisterhood," as Garth and Cathy always called the
Evergreens, where the Palmers lived.  The
eldest sister, Hope, was cosmopolitan in her
charities,&mdash;knitted woollen jugs and socks for the
missionary boxes of half the neighbourhood, was
a strong advocate of the temperance movement,
and was a little shaky in her church principles,
having, as her sisters well knew, a decided
leaning to the society of the Plymouth Sisters.
</p>

<p>
The second sister, Prudence, managed the
household, and divided her time between her
store-room and her district.  "I am not as clever
as the others; but I wait on Charity," said Miss
Faith, with an unconscious pathos in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"'Faith waiting on Charity.'  Poor cardinal
virtues," thought the girl, with a little smile
of amusement over the odd play of words.  "I
suppose Faith has plenty of waiting and looking
up in this world.  To judge by some women's
lives, some must wait for ever," soliloquized the
young philosopher with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
She speculated for a short time on this
Charity, who had been handsomer than any of
them, and had met with an accident in her
youth, whose view was bounded by four walls,
and who lived in her books.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Marriott, Cara is so clever.
You should hear her talk.  She and Mr. Logan
have such interesting conversation; it is quite
wonderful to hear them.  What a blessing it is
to have a well-stored mind; no empty space for
discontent to creep in, as Cara says.  I often
wish I were clever," continued the simple woman,
"and then one would not need to perplex one's
self so about the meanings of things.  Life never
seems such a puzzle to Cara as it does to me."
</p>

<p>
But here Cathy, who had overheard the last
sentences, interrupted her scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Do you call it life?" curling her lip scornfully.
"Are such meagre existences really life?
Life pre-supposes movement, animation,
sensation, coloring, plenty of work, but above all,
movement; not sitting in a close room, putting
in patches and listening to chapters of Physical
Geography.  Every one knows you are a saint,
Miss Faith," continued Cathy, enthusiastically.
"I know Garth thinks so.  But, all the same, life
means a little more than patches and dissertations
on the Gulf Stream."
</p>

<p>
"You young things are so impetuous," returned
poor Miss Faith with a tremulous smile; "perhaps
at your age one may have felt the same.
There is a sort of fever in young blood, I think.  I
remember how we used to feel in the spring-time;
it made one's pulses beat faster only to hear the
birds singing in their little new nests."
</p>

<p>
"You thought of something else besides patching
then," persisted Cathy, rebelliously.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I love sewing; and then what else
can one do when one is not clever.  I used to
wish I could find work in some children's hospital;
nursing is my forte, you know.  I think I could
have been quite happy if I had some young creatures
round me.  I tried for a little while, you
remember; and then Cara wanted me, and I came
home."
</p>

<p>
"And I have never forgiven Cara to this day,"
was the angry response.  "You looked like a
different woman when you came home from
Carlisle, Miss Faith,&mdash;years younger and brighter,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my dear, hush!  I am not very clever,
but I have learned one thing,&mdash;never to leave a
certain duty for an uncertain one.  It is a safe
rule; you will find it so, Cathy.  I often think of
my children, and long to be back with them; but
nothing would induce me to leave Cara while she
wants me."
</p>

<p>
There was a slight lull in the conversation, and
Miss Faith's voice dropped to a whisper.  A fresh
wind blew over the wide moor.  Some black-faced
mountain sheep browsed among the heather; one
of them had strayed on to the line, and the little
engine slackened speed.  The wild, somewhat
barren scenery, the novel mode of traffic, the sweet
moorland air, charmed and exhilarated Queenie;
she squeezed Emmie's hand as she whispered to
her, "Don't you love Miss Faith?"  "Faith
waiting on Charity," she said to herself with a
little sigh.
</p>

<p>
The quarry was in sight by this time.  Trucks
of the blasted stones were being shunted hither
and thither; then came the work-sheds and
ponderous machinery.  Queenie followed the
others, as Garth led them from one point to
another.  She listened as breathlessly as Emmie
to his description of the blasting; she tried to
imagine the vast report echoing over those lonely
moors, the terrified sheep huddled far away in
heaps, the masses of fallen rocks, and then started
a little as she found Garth looking down at her
with earnest eyes.
</p>

<p>
"All this is new to you, a fresh experience.
You have not hewn lessons out of rocks all your
life long, as I have," observed the young man
sententiously.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered a little timidly; "but
then I am only a governess."
</p>

<p>
"That means a bookworm.  Are you very
learned, Miss Marriott?  I wonder you have not
frightened Langley.  Rocks and men have been
my books," continued Garth, waving his hand at
the rough cliff half torn down, but wearing
graceful fronds of ferns in its crevices.  "There are
hard durable lessons to be learnt here: how to
overcome difficulties, how to war with opposition.
I would rather be here among my quarrymen
than on the benches of the House of
Commons."
</p>

<p>
Queenie gave a swift upward glance, but did
not answer.  "A king among men," she was
saying to herself softly.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot think how I pity business
men in cities," Garth went on, as he walked
beside her.  "Boys fresh from school chained
for the best part of their lives to the desk;
cramped up in a close atmosphere, bringing all
their best energies, their choicest talents, down
to the level of dull routine,&mdash;money-getting,
money-loving,&mdash;-narrowed to a perfect machinery
of existence."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are a little unjust and prejudiced
there," replied Queenie, with some spirit; "you
may love your life best, and I dare say you are
right.  You have freedom and rule, two very
good things."
</p>

<p>
"And plenty of fresh air," put in Garth,
baring his head as he spoke to the sweet
moorland wind that met them.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and that too.  But these men are to be
honored, because they make the best of their
life.  Many of them do not like it; a few rebel;
others get cramped and narrowed, as you say.
But to do one's work in the world, and to do it
worthily,&mdash;how distasteful and full of drudgery
and routine as it may be,&mdash;is to be a man in the
truest sense of the word," finished Queenie, with
a sudden sparkle in her brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Very properly put.  Do you think I do not
agree with you?  I am only comparing my lot
with others, a little to their disparagement.
There is Ted, there, that brother of mine,&mdash;would
you believe it, Miss Marriott!&mdash;I think you must
take him in hand, and preach contentment,&mdash;he
vows this place is a howling desert; no society;
not a thing to do.  It must be owned," continued
Garth, candidly, "that for a fellow without
resources Hepshaw may be a trifle dull,
especially in the winter."
</p>

<p>
"Do you never find it so, Mr. Clayton?"
asked Queenie, with a little natural surprise.  It
still seemed strange to her that this man, so
young and distinguished-looking, should own
himself contented with a position where he had
few equals and no superiors.
</p>

<p>
"Dull! do you mean to compare me to Ted,
who is lazy, and has no resources?" returned the
young man, slightly discomfited.  "What is there
that my life lacks?  I have a good home, sisters,
a plague of a brother.  It is my own fault, I
suppose, if I have no closer ties," continued
Garth, with a little laugh, and coloring slightly;
"but there is plenty of time for that.  I have
more work than I know how to do; and then
there is cricket and foot-ball; and lectures and
the chess-club for winter's evening.  I sometimes
wish my days were double their length.  That
does not look like dulness," finished Garth, in a
chafed tone, as though something in her words
had offended him.
</p>

<p>
Queenie held her ground a little obstinately;
she was on the brink of a discovery.  What was
the one jarring element in this honest sweet
nature?  Was it pride? or&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You may have all this, and yet you may
miss a great deal of what your despised city men
call life," she went on, with an old-fashioned
sagacity that surprised the young man, who was
simple enough in his way.  "You miss contact
with other minds.  Here you can have no
opportunity of gleaning new ideas.  There must
be a certain amount of stagnation here.  Cathy
knows what I mean; she and I have often talked
of it."  She finished with slight abruptness,
somewhat provoked by the incredulous smile
that rose to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Stagnation here!"  How Queenie wished he
would not repeat her words.  "You are hard on
us and Hepshaw.  Of course we are simple
country folk; we do not aspire to be anything
else; but a peaceful and independent existence
does not necessarily mean stagnation."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton, why will you persist in
misunderstanding me?" returned Queenie, in a vexed
voice.  They were standing at the extreme edge
of a jutting piece of rock; the others had turned
back, and were watching some machinery at
work; below them lay the wide moor.  Some
peewits were flitting hither and thither; a bank
of white clouds sailed slowly away westward.
"I am not hard on Hepshaw; I feel already that I
love it dearly.  I only thought that you, being a man,
must sometimes long for a little more society."
</p>

<p>
"Because I am like Ted, and have no
resources, I suppose?" but this time there was a
mollified gleam in his eyes.  "I think I am one
of the quiet sort; a few friends content me.
Mr. Logan is a host in himself, with sufficient
information to stock half-a-dozen ordinary men,
not to mention Captain Fawcett, who has
travelled and seen the world; and then we have
Harry Chester at Karldale, and Mr. Ray, the
Vicar of Karlsmere, and the Sowerbys of
Blandale Grange,&mdash;very sensible good people,&mdash;and
the Cunninghams, Dora and her father at
Crossgill Vicarage.  My sisters must take you over
there, Miss Marriott.  One can have friends
enough for the asking," continued Garth, loftily.
"I always disliked crowds of acquaintances; I
am not like Ted."
</p>

<p>
Queenie gave him an understanding glance,
but her closed lips offered no response.  The
shrewd little observer of human nature was
saying to herself, "I have found you out,
Mr. Clayton; you are good, but you are not perfect.
Cathy is right.  It is better, so you think, to be
the leading man in Hepshaw, and king in
Warstdale, than to be simply Mr. Clayton in London
or Carlisle; to lord it over inferior minds than
to mix with superior intelligences;" and, as she
recognized this trait, something like a pang of
disappointment crossed her mind.
</p>

<p>
Was he not a sort of hero to her? and ought
not heroes to be perfect?
</p>

<p>
"It strikes me that I have been very egotistical,
and that you must be very tired," he said at
last, rousing her from her reverie, and turning
his bright face full on her with such a kindly
look that her brief disdain died from that
moment.  "Let us come and see how Ted has
managed the luncheon; he always acts as my
steward on these occasions."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder who Dora is," thought Queenie, as
they walked leisurely back behind some laden
trucks.  "I wonder if Cathy has ever mentioned
her.  Dora Cunningham and her father at
Crossgill Vicarage!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
QUEENIE'S COUNSELLOR.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "Thou cam'st not to thy place by accident,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the very place God meant for thee;<br>
  And should'st thou there small scope for action see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not for this give room to discontent."&mdash;<i>Trench.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ted had proved himself an able steward,
and a sufficiently luxurious luncheon had been
conjured up for their refreshment.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had never in her life been present at
a stranger picnic,&mdash;a table had been set at the
base of a jutting cliff, and boxes and emptied
hampers formed rude seats for the party.  The
brothers presided, and Ted's boyish face beamed
with innocent satisfaction at the result of his
successful management.  "Isn't this first-rate,"
he whispered to Queenie who sat beside him.
"Not a drop of rain to spoil enjoyment, and only
enough wind to blow the table-cloth off once.
We broke one bottle of cream, but that's nothing;
you must have some champagne.  Garth always
does things handsomely for the ladies.  Miss
Cosie," persuasively, "you will have just half a
glass to drink Garth's health?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, not a drop; what an idea, and I a
total abstainer!" and Miss Cosie's big curls quite
shook with excitement.  "I wish you and your
dear brother would think with me on this
subject.  If only more of his men would sign the
pledge; fancy Hepshaw without a single
public-house! why it would be paradise over again,"
continued the little woman, patting his coatsleeve
in her energy; "but there, there, my dear,
we can't expect old heads on young shoulders."
</p>

<p>
After luncheon the party broke up into twos
and threes.  Garth had half-an-hour's business to
transact; Ted volunteered to help Miss Faith
and Cathy in their search for ferns; Langley
and Miss Cosie superintended the repacking of
hampers; while Captain Fawcett strolled with
Mr. Chester across the moor, leaving his wife in
delighted guard over the two children.  Queenie
had declined to join in the fern scramble, and
she and Mr. Logan seated themselves on some
granite boulders; there Garth found them on
his return.  More than an hour had elapsed, the
rest of the party had disappeared.  Nan and
Emmie were playing at fortifications among the
rocks.  A merry voice from the cliff above called
to Mr. Logan; he pushed his spectacles off his
forehead in a perplexed way as he rose slowly in
obedience to the summons.
</p>

<p>
"You and I will talk about this again, my
dear young lady, we have plenty of time;
nothing need be settled in a hurry.  I confess
you have taken me somewhat by surprise, but I
will promise you that I will think well over it,
and let you know."
</p>

<p>
"What are you and the Vicar prosing about?"
asked Garth with good-humored curiosity, as he
threw himself down on an old shepherd's plaid
beside her, and stretched himself luxuriously.
"Has the dear old pedant been treating you to
the results of some of his antiquarian researches?
You look tired and grave, Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"Because I am discussing a grave subject,"
she returned, rather nervously, pulling at some
grasses that grew between the stones, and splitting
the thin stalks of the weeds as she spoke.  "I
was asking Mr. Logan's advice about something;
most likely he will speak to you; at least he
said he recommended me to speak myself,"
faltered Queenie, growing pale all at once with
the difficulty of imparting her plans to a
stranger.
</p>

<p>
"You are in some uncertainty; you want
advice, assistance, and you do not like to trust
such new acquaintances," he replied quietly, with
such thorough comprehension of her unusual
diffidence, and with such evident intention of
breaking through it, that Queenie's uncomfortable
timidity yielded a little.
</p>

<p>
"I am only a stranger among you, and I have
no right to trouble you with my affairs; only
Mr. Logan said&mdash;" but he interrupted her with
good-humored peremptoriness.
</p>

<p>
"You shall tell me by-and-bye what Mr. Logan
said.  Let us settle this little piece of
business first.  I like to be troubled with other
people's affairs, it is a hobby of mine, and makes
me feel of more consequence;" and then, a little
gravely, "I do not look upon my sister's intimate
friends as strangers.'
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind," hesitating.
</p>

<p>
"We mean to be, if you will allow us such a
privilege, Miss Marriott.  I hope you mean to
tell us how we can be of service to you and your
little sister.  You want advice, you say?  I am
not as clever as Mr. Logan; but then, every one
knows business men are more practical than the
clergy.  Supposing you tell me all about it, your
plan and everything," finished Garth, in a
comfortable, matter-of-fact tone, as he stretched
himself again on the shepherd's plaid, but at the
same time he shot a keen anxious glance at the
young face above him; and, indeed, the sadness
in Queenie's brown eyes might have touched a
harder heart than Garth's.
</p>

<p>
"There is little to say," she replied, with a
quick flush.  It was one thing telling her troubles
to Mr. Logan, who was kind and fatherly, and
who looked about fifty, whatever his age might
be; but to tell them to this young man, who
spoke to her with such pleasant peremptoriness,
who was at once gentle and yet masterful, who
never let her forget for a moment that he was
Garth Clayton of Warstdale, well, it was different.
And yet he might be able to help her and
Emmie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is so painful to have to trouble you
with such things," she said with a little
impatience and quiver of suppressed annoyance in
her voice; "that is the worst of being a woman,
that one must be helpless, and trouble people."
</p>

<p>
"I rather enjoy this sort of trouble," he replied
coolly; "I like to be of use, and to give advice.
We are only wasting time, and the others will be
back.  Supposing you tell me all about it,"
continued Garth, with a bright persuasive smile,
quite comprehending her difficulty, but making
light of it in his masculine way.  "I am years
younger than the Vicar, but you will find that
we business men are just as much to be trusted."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I know.  I think men have the best
of it in everything," continued poor Queenie,
ashamed of her irritation, and yet conscious of
feeling it all the time.  "They are independent,
they can carve out their own lot in life; it is
women only who are so helpless.  After all, there
is little to tell.  I am not ashamed of being poor;
I never was in my life.  I want to work for
myself and Emmie, and I think I have found
something that will suit me in Hepshaw."
</p>

<p>
"In Hepshaw!" Garth raised himself on his
elbow, and gazed at her in unfeigned astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it is humble, but I know it will suit
me; and then Emmie will have country air, and
we shall not be separated.  You look surprised,
Mr. Clayton; surely you guess what I mean!
Cathy tells me that you are going to lose your
girls' school-mistress, and I want Mr. Logan to
elect me in her stead."
</p>

<p>
"And what did he say?" asked Garth in a
tone of such utter bewilderment that Queenie
nearly laughed.
</p>

<p>
"He seemed almost as astonished as you are,
and tried by every means in his power to
dissuade me.  He said it was absurd to throw
away myself and my talents on a village school,
that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He was right, of course," returned Garth,
interrupting her; "we must do better for you
than this, Miss Marriott; the scheme cannot be
entertained for a moment.  Why our
school-mistress has only forty pounds a-year!  We
might make it fifty, perhaps; but for a
lady&mdash;  He is right; it is too absurd."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! please do not make up your mind
that it is impossible.  I have set my heart upon
this, ever since I came; and Cathy told me the
school-mistress was gone.  I want it for Emmie's
sake, because she must have country air, and we
cannot be separated.  We would rather starve
on a crust together than be separated," continued
Queenie, speaking with feverish energy, and the
tears springing to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"But, Miss Marriott&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Clayton, you must listen to me,
please.  I have no such grand prospects before
me; a junior teacher in a school cannot
command a high salary.  If I went back to Carlisle
it would only be drudgery over again, with no
Emmie.  No; you must hear me," silencing him
as he attempted to speak: "this is a wiser plan
than you think.  I have forty pounds a-year of
my own, it is nothing very great, but it all
helps; and then I might give French lessons to
Mrs. Morris's children in the evening.  Cathy
says Mrs. Morris is so anxious for them to have
lessons; she and I were awake half the night
planning it, and Cathy said&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did she say?" as Queenie paused.
</p>

<p>
"That I must speak to you and Mr. Logan,
and that you would be sure to help me.  There is
that little cottage of Captain Fawcett's to be let;
we were looking at it yesterday.  Do you think it
would be very dear?" asked Queenie anxiously.
"It would do so nicely for Emmie and me, if the
rent were not too high."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that ramshackle wilderness of
a cottage just fronting the lane?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it would be very pretty if it were only
freshened up a little, and the garden put in order."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it might not be so bad," returned
Garth reluctantly.  "Rents are not very high
here; I dare say Fawcett would let you have it
for about fifteen pounds a-year, and do it up
properly besides.  Let me see, there was some
furniture belonging to it, that will go for a
mere song."
</p>

<p>
"I forgot about the furniture," owned Queenie
candidly.  "We must be content with very little
at first, just a table and a few chairs or so.
I have only a few pounds to spare, but Caleb
would advance me the rest.  Fifteen pounds
a-year! do you really think that Captain Fawcett
will let the cottage to us for that?"
</p>

<p>
"I can answer for it, certainly he will.
You can leave that part to me; you need not
distress yourself about that little matter of detail;
as far as that goes I can promise to secure your
election to-morrow.  All I want to know is, if
you be serious in this matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton, how can you ask me such a
question?"
</p>

<p>
"I call it a monstrous notion."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will not argue about it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Impracticable and absurd to the last degree.
Good heavens, Miss Marriott!" flinging back
his head with a gesture of mingled excitement
and wrath, "have you no friend or relative to
stand by you, and prevent you from throwing
yourself away on this miserable pittance?"
</p>

<p>
"I have one very good friend, but he is poor,"
returned the girl, and then she sighed.
Something in Garth's manner&mdash;his assumed roughness,
his suppressed wrath, the sudden break and
softening of his voice as he uttered his short
remonstrance&mdash;touched and yet pained her.  What
would it be to have a brother to work for her
when she needed support, a strong arm that
could protect her in times of emergency!
</p>

<p>
Poor self-reliant Queenie felt her bravery
oozing out.  Suddenly a pang of self-pity crossed
her as she pictured the future.  Would it always
be work and drudgery for herself and Emmie? must
she for ever go through life with this weak
burthen round her neck, toiling, toiling, with the
child's feeble hand in hers?
</p>

<p>
"Friends will not be wanting to us; heaven
helps those who help themselves," she cried with
a clasp of her hands and another involuntary
sigh.  "I am not afraid&mdash;not often, I mean.  I
prayed for work; and now work has come, and I
do not mean to shrink from it.  I hope you and
your sisters will not be ashamed of knowing
me when I am only a village school-mistress.
Are you sure you will not mind&mdash;for your
sisters, I mean? turning on him a little
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think such a question deserves an
answer?" somewhat reproachfully.  "You do not
know us yet, Miss Marriott.  We shall honor
you more in your poverty and independence
than if you came amongst us rolling in riches.
Rich people are my abhorrence, women especially.
Agar's prayer&mdash;'Give me neither poverty nor
wealth'&mdash;always pleased me.  I am an odd
fellow, and have my hobbies and facts like other
men&mdash;this is one of them."
</p>

<p>
"It is a very comfortable one, as far as I am
concerned.  Then you will promise to help me
with your influence with Mr. Logan and Captain
Fawcett?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I must, if you will let me have
my grumble out first.  Recollect, I enter my
remonstrance; I do not approve of your scheme
in the least."
</p>

<p>
"You have made me understand that most fully."
</p>

<p>
"I denounce it as moral suicide."
</p>

<p>
"I call that exaggeration."
</p>

<p>
"You are burying yourself alive under a
mistaken notion of self-sacrifice; and mark my
words, I am no true prophet if you do not live
to repent it."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I intend to be very happy.
Cathy is going to help me with my garden, and
we mean to read German together."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will allow your friends to subscribe
for your funeral if the crust should prove
not quite so sufficing as you imagine?"
</p>

<p>
"You need not fear anything so tragic; Emmie
and I mean to flourish on our crusts as much
as Daniel and the three children did on their
pulse and water," returned Queenie gaily, whose
spirits had risen now her formidable task was
achieved.  "I shall speak to them both
to-morrow, and get it off my mind," she had said
to Cathy the previous night, when they had
discussed the grand question in all its bearings,
under cover of the summer darkness, and with
the scent of Langley's roses steeping the air.
"There is no time to be lost; Mr. Logan is
writing to Carlisle for a mistress, and I must
speak to him at once."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's buoyancy had returned, but Garth
remained silent.  He had done his duty, and
uttered his protest against this monstrous scheme,
which, nevertheless, he was bound to further by
all means in his power.
</p>

<p>
"Quixotic, absurd, girlish to the last degree,"
he muttered to himself, and yet he felt he
respected and liked the girl all the better for her
modest independence.  Two days ago they had
been strangers, and now they had entered on a
mutual league of friendship and support.  "I
have promised to see you through this, so you
may leave all business details to me," he said
with a little condescension, which, in spite of
everything, amused Queenie.  "Half-measures
are not in my line; if you want help from me
you will be sure to get it," finished Garth; and
Queenie felt amused and grateful in a breath.
</p>

<p>
Garth was a little silent after this; the young
man felt an odd thrill, half painful and half
pleasant, at the recognition of this new
responsibility.  This young stranger had unconsciously
thrown herself upon his protection.  In asking his
advice she had appealed strongly to his
generosity.  To be sure, Queenie would not have read
matters in this light, indeed, would have rebelled
at such a statement; but Garth judged otherwise.
Tenderness to all weakness was inherent
in his nature; women, children, and animals
always trusted themselves involuntarily to him;
his shoulders were broad enough to incur a mass
of responsibility that would have crushed most
people.  "It was Garth's chief happiness to help
people," his sisters always said.  True, he must
help them in his own way, and they must submit
to his good-natured dictates, flavored a little
arbitratively perhaps; but his sympathy and ready
help would always be forthcoming.  No one ever
appealed to Garth Clayton's generosity in vain.
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a long time after this, revolving
all sorts of schemes for the sisters' benefit.
Once or twice, as she sat beside him, he glanced
at her with kindly scrutiny.  "She was not much
like a village school-mistress," he thought, as
he noted the quiet, refined face, the pretty
figure, the brown dress enlivened with the knot
of white rose-buds, the hat with the pheasant's
plume.  "Where has she picked up that air of
finish and elegance? it struck me from the first.
I suppose some fellows would give anything to
be in my place," thought the young philosopher,
a little elated, and yet puzzled at his own
position.  "She is very unlike Dora, quite a
contrast; they are neither of them pretty, at least
not strictly so.  Dora is the more attractive, but
Miss Marriott's eyes are wonderful; I never saw
any in the least like them, not that I concern
myself about such matters," finished the patriarch
of eight-and-twenty, pulling his moustache with
an amused air.
</p>

<p>
But for all that he roused himself rather
reluctantly as Cathy and Mr. Logan came
towards them, dragging a large basket of ferns
between them.  Cathy looked hot and flushed,
and just a trifle perturbed.  She left her hold of
the basket a little impatiently, and flung herself
down by Queenie.
</p>

<p>
"How provokingly cool you two look.  Here
have Ted and I been working like galley-slaves,
until Mr. Logan chose to come and break in on
our work."
</p>

<p>
"She was overtiring herself, so I took away
the trowel," returned Mr. Logan, with an expression
of quiet humor.  "Moderation in everything,
Miss Catherine, even in fern-hunting.  St. Paul's
rule is the best."
</p>

<p>
"I like to be my own taskmaster," grumbled
Cathy, who seemed to be in one of her impracticable
moods.  "Queen, for pity's sake come with
me for a run across the moor.  I have been
so long with Miss Faith and Mr. Logan that
I shall have a 'break out' directly, as the
prison matron calls it, unless I associate for
a little with less desperately good people.
Moderation even in this is the best rule,"
continued Cathy aggravatingly, drawing up her
graceful figure, and darting a defiant look at
Mr. Logan.  "After all, St. Paul was right; so
come along, Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"Kitty, whatever has put you into such a
bad temper?" asked her friend affectionately,
linking her arm in the girl's as they crossed the
tramway.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; he treats me like a child, and I
will not bear it.  He puts me in one of my
tantrums, and then pities and drives me wild with
that gentle way of his.  I hate to feel so ashamed
of myself, and he knows it."
</p>

<p>
"But what is it all about?" asked Queenie, a
little bewildered at this sudden storm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know, I never do know, that is
just the aggravating part.  I say something in
my usual way, and then he puts me down and
argues with me, and proves that he is right and
I am wrong; and then when I get cross, and
human nature won't bear such an amount of
contradiction,&mdash;at least mine won't,&mdash;he just says I
am tired, and takes away my trowel.  I know all
the time he is laughing at me in his quiet way,
and saying to himself, 'that poor foolish child.'"
</p>

<p>
"But, Cathy, there is no harm in that."
</p>

<p>
"There is harm when I am no child, when I do
not feel like one, when&mdash;but I won't talk about
it any more.  Let us have a race,
Queen&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;away," and Cathy flew down the
moor with a swift, bird-like movement, her small
head erect, but not before Queenie had caught
the gleam of something like a tear on one long
eyelash.
</p>

<p>
Just then a whistle from Garth summoned the
scattered party together.  The afternoon was far
advanced; some evening clouds skirted the edge
of the moor; the children were weary.  The little
engine steamed up slowly towards them, and all
hands were busy in packing the hampers and
baskets on the truck.
</p>

<p>
Cathy stood aside a little sulkily while the rest
clambered into their places.  Queenie, who was
watching them, saw that Mr. Logan wanted to
assist her, but Cathy would have none of his
help; she was therefore a little surprised when he
followed her, and seated himself persistently by
their side.
</p>

<p>
"So you have not forgiven an old friend for
having the best of an argument," he said at last,
after vainly trying to draw her in the conversation.
Queenie had flung herself gallantly into
the breach, but Cathy remained obstinately
silent.
</p>

<p>
"She is tired, Christopher, my dear," suddenly
interrupted Miss Cosie's little chirping voice;
"nothing is more wearying than talking when one
wants their tea, and I am sure I want mine.
Mrs. Fawcett has been saying the same thing just
now; there, there, we shall get it presently, I
dare say, and Langley always makes such beautiful
tea, as I tell her."
</p>

<p>
"Are you tired, Miss Catherine? then I will
not talk to you any more," was the gentle reply,
and Mr. Logan quietly turned his attention to
Queenie.
</p>

<p>
The waggonettes were waiting for them at
the entrance of the Warstdale works, and a short
drive deposited them at the dark porch of
Church-Stile House.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan was standing apart for a moment
under the sycamore trees, when Cathy suddenly
walked up to him.  The girl's cheek was crimson,
her eyes were still a little defiant.  "Miss Cosie
was wrong, I was not tired.  I let you believe
what was not true.  I was only vexed and put
out with myself, as I often am," wrinkling her
smooth brow and speaking quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I am always sure to hear the truth at last
from you, Miss Catherine," he replied, with a kind
look and smile, as he held out his hand to her;
and then Cathy sprang away into the house.
</p>

FAITH AND CHARITY.

  "That them may'st pray for them thy foes are given;<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The evening festivities had been closed as
usual by the family concert, during which
Garth had distinguished himself with more than
ordinary brilliancy.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had been a little thoughtful and absent,
but she had no idea that her pre-occupation
had been observed until she bade Garth
good night, and he followed her into the little
hall, and lighted her candle.
</p>

<p>
"What is the use of worrying yourself over a
lot of unnecessary details?" he said, looking
down at her with an elder-brotherly air.  "Things
can't be settled in a minute.  Leave everything
to me; I will see you through your difficulties.
The best thing will be to put it all out of your
head for a little while, until I give you leave to
think of it."
</p>

<p>
"I will try; but it will not be very easy,
when so much depends upon it," she returned,
submissively.
</p>

<p>
They were standing alone together in the little
square hall; a lamp burned dimly in a recess;
the candle flared between them in the summer
draught; a grey moth brushed round them.
Outside was the shadow of the dark sycamores.
A little runlet of water trickled audibly in the
silence.  Garth's broad shoulders seemed to block
up the tiny hall; he towered above Queenie's
slim, girlish figure, looking down upon her with
condescending dignity, but with the gleam of real
kindness in his eyes.  As he held out his hand
his firm, warm pressure seemed reassuring.
</p>

<p>
"That is all the more reason to leave it to
me.  We business men are used to deal with
difficulties.  Nothing hurts me; I am strong
enough to bear any amount of responsibility."  And
Queenie went up-stairs comforted.
</p>

<p>
Garth's assurance was not unnecessary.  For
some days nothing further passed between them
on the subject of her project.  Garth never
alluded to it; and but for those few words
Queenie might have felt uneasy.  As it was she
had some difficulty in keeping her restlessness
down.  It cost her an effort at times to appear
unrestrained, and to join in the ordinary topics
of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I try to do as he tells me, and put it out of
my mind; but it is so hard when so much
depends upon it," she would say to Cathy when
they retired for the night.  "I hope it is not
wrong; but I have set my heart on carrying out
this scheme.  I get fonder of this place every
day, and so does Emmie.  I never was so happy
in my life!" finished Queenie, with a little sob
of excitement.
</p>

<p>
"You dear old Queen! as though we ever
meant to part with you!  Have you really only
been here a week?  How I enjoy having you;
and Langley says the same.  Never mind Garth's
silence, his few words mean more than a whole
hour of talk from any other man.  If he says he
will do a thing you may safely trust him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I know; but all the same, Mr. Logan
may not think me suitable for such a post,"
persisted Queenie, disconsolately, "and then I shall
be obliged to go back to Carlisle, and to part
with Emmie.  Oh, Cathy! it does seem so hard,
when we should be content with so little;" and
though Cathy helped her friend, and was very
kind and sympathizing, there was no denying
that the cause for suspense was a grave one.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had only stated the truth when she
had owned she had never been happier in her
life.  For the first time she had tasted the real
comfort of a happy, well-regulated home.  Queenie's
own youth had never known freedom from the
carking fret of a narrow income and incessant
burden of debt.  The remembrance of the petty
meanness, the shiftlessness, the continuous fight
with untoward circumstance, made retrospect
bitter to her.  She had grown up strong and
sturdy, like some blooming Alpine plant which
had taken root in a handful of earth on the edge
of a crevasse; the sunshine might be all about
her, but it had not gilded her one point of rock.
</p>

<p>
Here there was plenty without profusion,
comfort without pretension; a happy family
circle, rich in individuality, characteristic, strong
in will, with a fount of pure native humor
evidently engrained in the blood; and yet there
were fewer jars and less dissensions than
ordinarily occur in domestic life.
</p>

<p>
Ted was evidently the malcontent of the
household; but even his grumbling, incessant as it
was, had no root of bitterness in it.  He was only
a lazy, sweet-tempered fellow, who had not yet
fitted himself to his niche in life, and who was
young enough to quarrel with the monotony of
his existence.  "Look here!  I can't stand this
much longer; I shall have to cut it, after all, and
take to office work in Carlisle," he would say, when
he had secured the two girls as listeners, and had
extended himself after his usual fashion on the
long, narrow couch, with his arms under his
head, and his light hair standing on end.  "Do
you think a fellow of any spirit can endure life
in a hole like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ted, do be quiet; we are so tired of this
sort of talk," remonstrated his sister.
</p>

<p>
"I am not talking to you; I am talking to
Miss Marriott.  She is a girl of sense, and knows
what a fellow means when he says he is hipped,
and all that.  Do you think a place like
Hepshaw is meant for anything but a refuge for old
maids?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Teddie, you rude boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't interfere, Catherine; I am speaking
to your betters."
</p>

<p>
"Your brother seems perfectly content with
his surroundings; I should advise you to follow
his example," returned Queenie demurely, trying
hard not to laugh, and not unmindful of the
boyish kicks that were being administered to the
end of the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Garth!  Oh, he is different; he is a confirmed
old bachelor, a sort of philosopher on a
small scale.  I don't believe Garth would trouble
himself if he never saw a fresh face from one
year's end to another.  A man with a hobby is
always to be envied," sighed the poor victim of
circumstance.
</p>

<p>
"Get a hobby, then," snapped Cathy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is all very easy to talk."
</p>

<p>
"I know it is, or you would not lie railing
there, like the melancholy Jacques, against fate.
'I met a fool,' quoth he, 'a motley fool.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Call me not fool till heaven has sent me
fortune,'" growled Ted, with the spirit of reviving
fun in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"There, he is better now; when he begins to
quote we may safely leave him, Queenie.  I
want you to come with me and call on the
Cardinal Virtues; it is such a wet afternoon that
they will be in strong force.  Never mind Ted's
grumbling, he cannot expect you to stay at
home and talk to him; besides, he has 'David
Copperfield' to amuse him."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pay you out for this," returned her
brother, viciously.  "Just as Miss Marriott and
I had found out we were kindred spirits, and all
that sort of thing.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, woman! in your hour of ease<br>
  A wretched bore, or else a tease;<br>
  When pain and sickness wring the brow<br>
  A downright duffer then art thou.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Wasn't the old Caledonian one when he praised
up the weaker portion of the community in that
ridiculous fashion?" but as Cathy did not
condescend to reply, the passage of arms stopped.
</p>

<p>
The sisterhood were all gathered in the
pleasant parlor at the Evergreens.  A bright-eyed,
faded little woman lay on the couch in the
bay window knitting some bright-coloured strips
for an antimacassar.  She looked up and nodded
pleasantly as the friends entered.
</p>

<p>
"You always come to us on a wet afternoon,
Catherine, when visitors are most welcome.
Faith was reading to us; I dare say she will be
glad of a rest by this time.  We are in the fourth
volume of D'Aubigné's 'Reformation.'  Put a
marker in the place, Faith, and then we shall
lose no time when we open the book again.  Do
you know D'Aubigné, Miss Marriott?  it is most
improving reading for young people."
</p>

<p>
"Could this active-looking, talkative little
woman be the hopeless invalid of whom she had
heard so much?" Queenie asked herself, with
some bewilderment, as she sat down in the
comfortable chair that Miss Faith brought to her.
Though it was summer a little fire burned in the
grate; the window had been closed to exclude
the dampness.  Miss Faith's cheeks looked
unusually pale; her eyes were full of a soft
weariness.
</p>

<p>
"Charity is so fond of D'Aubigné; I think he
tires me a little.  It is very good reading, of
course; but in this summer weather, and with
the drip, drip of the rain on the leaves&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There were giants in those days," broke in
Miss Hope, vigorously.  "Luther was a grand
man, and so was Zwingle."  Miss Hope spoke in
a loud but not unpleasing voice.  She was a
stout, fresh-colored woman, not without a
certain degree of comeliness.  In her young
days she had been too high-coloured for beauty,
but now the grey hair toned and softened her
down.
</p>

<p>
Miss Prudence was less pleasing: she was tall
and angular, wore spectacles, and had that
slight appendage on the upper lip which is not
a strictly feminine adjunct.  Her voice was thin
in quality and somewhat harsh.  Queenie felt
that Ted's <i>soubriquet</i> of "the dragon" was not
badly bestowed.  It was she who held the
purse-strings of the little household, and who guarded
the proprieties.  Miss Hope, in spite of her
strong leaning to the Plymouth Brothers, and
her somewhat injudicious tyrannies in the matter
of temperance and total abstinence, was far less
rigid than her strong-minded sister.
</p>

<p>
No wonder Miss Faith drooped in such an
atmosphere! and then Miss Charity's voice!
Queenie, who was sensitive on such matters,
found fault with the ceaseless flow of words that
proceeded from the bay-window.  "She is
egotistical, selfish; she works that poor sister of
hers to death, I know she does," thought the girl
to herself, with a certain youthful antagonism
against oppression.  "Miss Faith is a saint; but
I wonder how she can bear it."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was a little hard in her judgment, as
young people often are in their estimate of things
and people.  There was selfishness, and possibly
oppression, in the continual sisterly sacrifice
demanded as a right; in the unpitying claims
made on the health and time so ungrudgingly
bestowed upon her.
</p>

<p>
In life, real life, we see these sort of sacrifices
perpetually exacted before our eyes somehow.
Human flesh and blood revolts against the sight.
The strong, sometimes the young, compelled to
put away their own life, and spend some of their
best years chained to the couch of helplessness;
condemned to share the burthen of an invalid
existence; exposed to petty tyrannies and
tempers, and bearing them out of pity for the
suffering that provokes them.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, indeed, it may be a labor of
love, a life within a life, of many-folded
sweetnesses blossoming out of the pain, as in the case
of an afflicted parent or husband.  Nay, one
often see admirable lives of sisterly or brotherly
devotion.  Yet are there sadder cases, when
duty and not love is the main-spring of action;
when the self-sacrifice is bitter though voluntary;
when the watcher would willingly change
places with the watched, that the bounding pulse
of health might be subdued; that the keen
suffering of repression and yearning, and God
only knows what bitter measure of woman's
pain, might be dulled and quieted by mere
bodily weakness.
</p>

<p>
To be free, only to be free, and live their
own lives&mdash;that is what some women vainly
crave; and then a stone is given them for bread.
Instead of work comes waiting&mdash;the hardest and
most trying form of work; instead of freedom
a mesh of finely-woven duties, light as gossamer
threads, yet binding the conscience like cart-ropes.
</p>

<p>
Queenie sat and mused with inward rebellion
while Charity talked about her books, and showed
her manuscript volumes of finely-copied extracts.
"I always write out passages that please me; it
is such a resource to read them afterwards.  I
want Faith to do the same, but she likes
mending and watering her flowers.  I prefer
thoughts to flowers, Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"Every one has a right to their taste.  I think
I share Miss Faith's," returned the girl, a little
ungraciously.  She felt no pity for the bright-eyed,
faded little woman, who made so much of
her life, and hid away her sufferings bravely,
much as the silk, patched coverlet hid the
useless shrunken limbs.
</p>

<p>
She would not even allow to Cathy that she
could have ever been pretty, as they walked
home together through the summer rain.
</p>

<p>
"Her face does not attract me in the least,
there is nothing in it; and then her cheek-bones
are so high, and her curls are so thin and limp.
Now, if she only braided them nicely under a
little close cap&mdash;and then her tongue; oh, Cathy!
I think she would drive me distracted in a week."
</p>

<p>
But Cathy stood up stoutly for Miss Charity.
</p>

<p>
"I must say that I think you a little prejudiced,"
she returned, with honest indignation,
and that natural love of opposition that incites
young people to do battle for the accused.  She
did not love Miss Charity in the least; but,
nevertheless, her sense of justice prompted her to
take up her defence.  "She is nice-looking now,
every one says so; and when she was young she
was more than pretty, positively beautiful,
before she met with her accident."
</p>

<p>
"Was it an accident that caused her illness?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she was a strong healthy girl, just like
us, fresh-colored and blooming; and her hair
used to be so pretty,&mdash;it was just that paler tinge
of gold that one sees with fair complexions, and
now the color seems all worked out of it.  She
used to be called the pretty Miss Palmer; and
then she was the only one of the four sisters who
were ever engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cathy, I thought you told me that there
was no one for them to marry!"
</p>

<p>
"I forgot Miss Charity's affair; she was
engaged to a young farmer in Wythiedale.  I
fancy he was a rough-and-ready sort of person;
but I believe she was fond of him, poor thing,
and then her accident happened."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of accident?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she fell down the granary steps when
she was spending the day at his father's.  It was
a dreadful affair; partial paralysis set in, and
there was a complication, and a great deal of
suffering; and then the doctor said it was
hopeless, and she was obliged to give him up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor Miss Charity!" ejaculated Queenie,
with tears in her eyes.  She could have gone
back and asked her pardon on the spot for all
the hard things she had thought.  "I never
dreamt of trouble like this; I can hardly bear to
hear of it.  What became of the poor fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the worst part of all," replied Cathy,
rather reluctantly; "his end was very miserable.
He broke his neck when he was out hunting.  His
horse fell, in trying to jump a five-barred gate,
and rolled over on him.  Some people said he
was not quite sober when it happened.  Whether
he grew reckless from the loss of her, or whether,
as it is strongly suspected, he was addicted to
intemperance from the first, I cannot possibly
tell; but I rather think that she must have been
deceived in him.  Of course no one was cruel
enough to hint at such a thing to her; and so
she treasures the memory of her poor George, as
she calls him."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cathy, what a terrible tragedy!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she was very ill for a time; and then
Miss Faith gave up her hospital, and came home
to nurse her.  Of course it sounds very bad, and
the poor thing has suffered a good deal one way
and another; but how do you know that it was
not all for the best?" finished Cathy, solemnly.
"Think if that accident had never happened, and
she had married him, and then found that he
was not worthy.  To be tied for life to a man, and
then to see him sink lower and lower, to despise
one's own husband!  Could you imagine any
greater torment than that?  If it were I, I know
I should get to hate him.  Nothing should make
me live with such a man; I would beg my
bread first," cried the girl, with sparkling eyes,
and setting her small white teeth together.  "To
despise one's husband! oh, Queenie, think how
dreadful!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose such a thing could happen
to either of us.  Poor Miss Charity! perhaps it
was a blessing in disguise after all; but to think
of caring for D'Aubigné's 'Reformation', and copying
out all those rubbishing extracts, after living
through such a tragedy as that! it seems so
incomprehensible."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the sun and the moon ought
to have stood still in her little firmament? don't
you know hearts are broken every day, and the
world goes on just as usual?" returned Cathy,
sententiously.  She and Queenie seemed to
have changed characters that afternoon; it was
Cathy who was calm and philosophical.  At
another time her old-fashioned wisdom would
have provoked a smile, but Queenie was too
much in earnest.
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought her story would have
been more plainly written in her face.  If it had
been Miss Faith now&mdash;  Cathy, you look queer;
has Miss Faith ever had a story too?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly.  I don't know, no one
does; but I always fancied there was some
attraction beside the sick children in that
hospital.  Langley's suspicions were aroused
when she went over to Carlisle once; but she
would not like me to repeat such nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"But why should I not know?  Oh, Cath! there
could never be any harm in telling me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as it was ten years ago, perhaps not.
I don't know what made Langley say such a
thing, but she spoke to me once of a dark young
surgeon, who came up to them in the ward, and
talked to them for a long time.  Langley said
nothing crossed her mind until she saw him look
at Miss Faith, and then, somehow, the thought
got into her mind."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but a look?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, there is a great deal to be read in
looks," returned Cathy, demurely.  "It was just
the beginning, I dare say, of a possible romance.
When Miss Charity's trouble happened, and poor
Miss Faith came home to nurse her, every one
said it was grief at her sister's state that made
her so grave and unlike herself; but Langley
always believes that that dark young surgeon
had something to do with it, and so do I.  I
dare say this was one of the 'might-have-beens'
that have spoiled many women's lives."
</p>

<p>
"But Miss Faith is not so old,&mdash;only
five-and-thirty,&mdash;and she is still so sweet-looking."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, we are speaking of mere looks, and
ten years ago; most likely he has married and
has half-a-dozen children by this time; and
remember, they have never even met since.
Perhaps he has grown stout and bald, those dark
young men do get stout sometimes.  I am a
little cynical, but I cannot believe in such
faithfulness as that.  Men are such fickle
creatures, my dear, 'out of sight is out of mind' with
most of them."
</p>

<p>
"Pray where did you learn those abominable
sentiments?" asked her brother curtly, as he
came up behind the girls, starting them into a
muttered exclamation of dismay.  How much
had he overheard? how was it that his footsteps
had gained upon them unperceived?  Quick
blushes burnt in the girls' faces.  Garth shook
off the raindrops and laughed mischievously; he
was master of the situation, his love of teasing
was paramount.
</p>

<p>
"Girls are all alike.  Fancy men talking to
each other about their love affairs, and choosing
a public thoroughfare for the tender confidence."
</p>

<p>
"Garth, you are a monster, and I hate you,"
burst out Cathy, stamping her little foot at him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton is utterly mistaken," observed
Queenie hotly; "we were only discussing other
people's affairs.  We are not often in such a
gossiping mood, but Cathy was communicative,
and I suppose I got interested."
</p>

<p>
"Is it also your opinion that men are such
fickle creatures?  I thought that was Cathy's
observation.  She has known so many men, and
has such a wide acquaintance with life.  I should
have thought Miss Titheridge and the dragon-guarded
portals of Granite Lodge would have
excluded the stronger and ruder sex, but perhaps
I am mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"Garth, when you are in this mood I detest you."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot have you infecting Miss Marriott's
mind with such heterodox notions; fickleness is
all on the other side, take my word for it.  I am
sorry that I only overheard the last words, as
Cathy's communications would doubtless have
proved both novel and instructive; a schoolgirl's
opinion on such points must be delicious.
Cathy, my dear, if you can spare Miss Marriott
one moment I have a word or two to say to her.
Step into my den there, please, while I hang up
my wet coat.  I will be with you in a moment."
</p>

<p>
Queenie obeyed him wonderingly.  She had
been in Garth's den before, Cathy had taken her,
but she looked round it with fresh interest.
</p>

<p>
There were the book-shelves he had made and
stained himself, loaded with his favorite
authors&mdash;Dickens, Thackeray, and Macaulay, "fine fellows
all of them," he would say; and his writing-table
with all its old bachelor's appurtenances,&mdash;the
pipe-rack and red earthen tobacco-jar; and the worn
easy-chair, the shabbiest and the most comfortable
in the house.  Opposite was the picture of
his mother, a large faded oil-painting of a woman,
not young, but with a sweet gentle face and
Garth's blue-grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
Queenie looked at it for some time, and then
she went to the window.  A little bird was
singing through the rain, the drops splashed
endlessly from the white-rose bush under the
window; the steep lawn planted sparsely with
trees ran down to the lane.  Langley's jessamine
and clove-pink steeped the wet air with fragrance;
a half-drowned bee clung to a spray of woodbine.
"Most people would call this dull; and how they
would hate that little gate leading to the
churchyard, and the thought of that granite monument
shining in the moonlight, but to me it is the
dearest place," thought Queenie, leaning against
the window-frame in sweet abstraction.
</p>

<p>
"Are you there, Miss Marriott?  I am so sorry
to have kept you waiting," observed Garth
apologetically, coming to her side in his quick way.
"Langley detained me with some questions of
domestic detail that could not be postponed."
</p>

<p>
"It does not matter, I was in no hurry.  Look
at that bee, Mr. Clayton; I was just going out to
rescue him; he is shipwrecked, and wants to save
his cargo of honey."
</p>

<p>
"You shall go to him by-and-bye.  I only
want to say a word to you.  I have talked to
Mr. Logan, and everything is arranged.  In a
month from this time you are to enter on your
new duties as mistress of the Hepshaw girls'
school."
